machine learning,Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with   short learning samples,The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is free of those flaws.
machine learning,MLBench: How Good Are Machine Learning Clouds for Binary Classification   Tasks on Structured Data?,"We conduct an empirical study of machine learning functionalities provided by major cloud service providers, which we call machine learning clouds. Machine learning clouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running large-scale machine learning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine learning task, users only specify what machine learning task to run and the cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?   We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement."

machine learning,AutoCompete: A Framework for Machine Learning Competition,"In this paper, we propose AutoCompete, a highly automated machine learning framework for tackling machine learning competitions. This framework has been learned by us, validated and improved over a period of more than two years by participating in online machine learning competitions. It aims at minimizing human interference required to build a first useful predictive model and to assess the practical difficulty of a given machine learning challenge. The proposed system helps in identifying data types, choosing a machine learn- ing model, tuning hyper-parameters, avoiding over-fitting and optimization for a provided evaluation metric. We also observe that the proposed system produces better (or comparable) results with less runtime as compared to other approaches."

Prior methods require an initial learning pass that trains the deep Boltzmann machine greedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classifi- cation tasks."

machine learning,Temporal-related Convolutional-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine capable of   learning relational order via reinforcement learning procedure?,"In this article, we extend the conventional framework of convolutional-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine to learn highly abstract features among abitrary number of time related input maps by constructing a layer of multiplicative units, which capture the relations among inputs. In many cases, more than two maps are strongly related, so it is wise to make multiplicative unit learn relations among more input maps, in other words, to find the optimal relational-order of each unit. In order to enable our machine to learn relational order, we developed a reinforcement-learning method whose optimality is proven to train the network."
machine learning,An Aggregate and Iterative Disaggregate Algorithm with Proven Optimality   in Machine Learning,"We propose a clustering-based iterative algorithm to solve certain optimization problems in machine learning, where we start the algorithm by aggregating the original data, solving the problem on aggregated data, and then in subsequent steps gradually disaggregate the aggregated data. We apply the algorithm to common machine learning problems such as the least absolute deviation regression problem, support vector machines, and semi-supervised support vector machines. We derive model-specific data aggregation and disaggregation procedures. We also show optimality, convergence, and the optimality gap of the approximated solution in each iteration. A computational study is provided."
machine learning,Bayesian Optimization for Machine Learning : A Practical Guidebook,"The engineering of machine learning systems is still a nascent field; relying on a seemingly daunting collection of quickly evolving tools and best practices. It is our hope that this guidebook will serve as a useful resource for machine learning practitioners looking to take advantage of Bayesian optimization techniques. We outline four example machine learning problems that can be solved using open source machine learning libraries, and highlight the benefits of using Bayesian optimization in the context of these common machine learning applications."
machine learning,Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning,"As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning."
machine learning,Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning: The Stanford DAWN Project,"Despite incredible recent advances in machine learning, building machine learning applications remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for all but the best-trained, best-funded engineering organizations. This expense comes not from a need for new and improved statistical models but instead from a lack of systems and tools for supporting end-to-end machine learning application development, from data preparation and labeling to productionization and monitoring. In this document, we outline opportunities for infrastructure supporting usable, end-to-end machine learning applications in the context of the nascent DAWN (Data Analytics for What's Next) project at Stanford."
machine learning,On-the-Fly Learning in a Perpetual Learning Machine,"Despite the promise of brain-inspired machine learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have frustratingly failed to bridge the deceptively large gap between learning and memory. Here, we introduce a Perpetual Learning Machine; a new type of DNN that is capable of brain-like dynamic 'on the fly' learning because it exists in a self-supervised state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, we provide the means to unify learning and memory within a machine learning framework. We also explore the elegant duality of abstraction and synthesis: the Yin and Yang of deep learning."
machine learning,Discussion on Mechanical Learning and Learning Machine,"Mechanical learning is a computing system that is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, and can learn from incoming data. A learning machine is a system that realizes mechanical learning. Importantly, we emphasis that it is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, contrasting to often called machine learning that is sophisticated software based on very complicated mathematical theory, and often needs human intervene for software fine tune and manual adjustments. Here, we discuss some basic facts and principles of such system, and try to lay down a framework for further study. We propose 2 directions to approach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to realize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical learning."

machine learning,Distributed Multi-Task Learning with Shared Representation,"We study the problem of distributed multi-task learning with shared representation, where each machine aims to learn a separate, but related, task in an unknown shared low-dimensional subspaces, i.e. when the predictor matrix has low rank. We consider a setting where each task is handled by a different machine, with samples for the task available locally on the machine, and study communication-efficient methods for exploiting the shared structure."
machine learning,Logistic Regression as Soft Perceptron Learning,"We comment on the fact that gradient ascent for logistic regression has a connection with the perceptron learning algorithm. Logistic learning is the ""soft"" variant of perceptron learning."
machine learning,A Survey on Resilient Machine Learning,"Machine learning based system are increasingly being used for sensitive tasks such as security surveillance, guiding autonomous vehicle, taking investment decisions, detecting and blocking network intrusion and malware etc. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models are venerable to attacks by adversaries at all phases of machine learning (eg, training data collection, training, operation). All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing down the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned mode, or causing the system make error(s) only in attacker's planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners. We present a survey of this emerging area in machine learning."
machine learning,Distributed Multitask Learning,"We consider the problem of distributed multi-task learning, where each machine learns a separate, but related, task. Specifically, each machine learns a linear predictor in high-dimensional space,where all tasks share the same small support. We present a communication-efficient estimator based on the debiased lasso and show that it is comparable with the optimal centralized method."
machine learning,Distributed Stochastic Multi-Task Learning with Graph Regularization,"We propose methods for distributed graph-based multi-task learning that are based on weighted averaging of messages from other machines. Uniform averaging or diminishing stepsize in these methods would yield consensus (single task) learning. We show how simply skewing the averaging weights or controlling the stepsize allows learning different, but related, tasks on the different machines."
machine learning,Learning Moore Machines from Input-Output Traces,"The problem of learning automata from example traces (but no equivalence or membership queries) is fundamental in automata learning theory and practice. In this paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and outputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of input-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the machine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a Moore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore machine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the fundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the algorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and several notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with OSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find that OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a characteristic sample."
machine learning,How Developers Iterate on Machine Learning Workflows -- A Survey of the   Applied Machine Learning Literature,"Machine learning workflow development is anecdotally regarded to be an iterative process of trial-and-error with humans-in-the-loop. However, we are not aware of quantitative evidence corroborating this popular belief. A quantitative characterization of iteration can serve as a benchmark for machine learning workflow development in practice, and can aid the development of human-in-the-loop machine learning systems. To this end, we conduct a small-scale survey of the applied machine learning literature from five distinct application domains. We collect and distill statistics on the role of iteration within machine learning workflow development, and report preliminary trends and insights from our investigation, as a starting point towards this benchmark. Based on our findings, we finally describe desiderata for effective and versatile human-in-the-loop machine learning systems that can cater to users in diverse domains."
machine learning,Meaningful Models: Utilizing Conceptual Structure to Improve Machine   Learning Interpretability,"The last decade has seen huge progress in the development of advanced machine learning models; however, those models are powerless unless human users can interpret them. Here we show how the mind's construction of concepts and meaning can be used to create more interpretable machine learning models. By proposing a novel method of classifying concepts, in terms of 'form' and 'function', we elucidate the nature of meaning and offer proposals to improve model understandability. As machine learning begins to permeate daily life, interpretable models may serve as a bridge between domain-expert authors and non-expert users."
machine learning,Quantum-enhanced machine learning,"The emerging field of quantum machine learning has the potential to substantially aid in the problems and scope of artificial intelligence. This is only enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning. In this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine learning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that quadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in performance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of learning problems."

Associations between these different variables can be obtained by applying machine learning algorithms to historical data. In this paper we present applications of different machine learning algorithms in aquaculture applications."

machine learning,Theoretical Robopsychology: Samu Has Learned Turing Machines,"From the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for the activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning applications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental theoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is constrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the Turing Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe itself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the present paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy point of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination of learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying agent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the problem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in reality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for learning Turing machines."
machine learning,An Introduction to MM Algorithms for Machine Learning and Statistical,"MM (majorization--minimization) algorithms are an increasingly popular tool for solving optimization problems in machine learning and statistical estimation. This article introduces the MM algorithm framework in general and via three popular example applications: Gaussian mixture regressions, multinomial logistic regressions, and support vector machines. Specific algorithms for the three examples are derived and numerical demonstrations are presented. Theoretical and practical aspects of MM algorithm design are discussed."
machine learning,Deep Learning and Its Applications to Machine Health Monitoring: A   Survey,"Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed."
machine learning,Machine Learned Learning Machines,"There are two common approaches for optimizing the performance of a machine: genetic algorithms and machine learning. A genetic algorithm is applied over many generations whereas machine learning works by applying feedback until the system meets a performance threshold. Though these are methods that typically operate separately, we combine evolutionary adaptation and machine learning into one approach. Our focus is on machines that can learn during their lifetime, but instead of equipping them with a machine learning algorithm we aim to let them evolve their ability to learn by themselves. We use evolvable networks of probabilistic and deterministic logic gates, known as Markov Brains, as our computational model organism. The ability of Markov Brains to learn is augmented by a novel adaptive component that can change its computational behavior based on feedback. We show that Markov Brains can indeed evolve to incorporate these feedback gates to improve their adaptability to variable environments. By combining these two methods, we now also implemented a computational model that can be used to study the evolution of learning."
machine learning,Information Theory and its Relation to Machine Learning,"In this position paper, I first describe a new perspective on machine learning (ML) by four basic problems (or levels), namely, ""What to learn?"", ""How to learn?"", ""What to evaluate?"", and ""What to adjust?"". The paper stresses more on the first level of ""What to learn?"", or ""Learning Target Selection"". Towards this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning (ITL [1]) and machine learning. A theorem is given on the relation between the empirically-defined similarity measure and information measures. Finally, a conjecture is proposed for pursuing a unified mathematical interpretation to learning target selection."
machine learning,The Case for Meta-Cognitive Machine Learning: On Model Entropy and   Concept Formation in Deep Learning,"Machine learning is usually defined in behaviourist terms, where external validation is the primary mechanism of learning. In this paper, I argue for a more holistic interpretation in which finding more probable, efficient and abstract representations is as central to learning as performance. In other words, machine learning should be extended with strategies to reason over its own learning process, leading to so-called meta-cognitive machine learning. As such, the de facto definition of machine learning should be reformulated in these intrinsically multi-objective terms, taking into account not only the task performance but also internal learning objectives. To this end, we suggest a ""model entropy function"" to be defined that quantifies the efficiency of the internal learning processes. It is conjured that the minimization of this model entropy leads to concept formation. Besides philosophical aspects, some initial illustrations are included to support the claims."
machine learning,Introduction to intelligent computing unit 1,This brief note highlights some basic concepts required toward understanding the evolution of machine learning and deep learning models. The note starts with an overview of artificial intelligence and its relationship to biological neuron that ultimately led to the evolution of todays intelligent models.
machine learning,Descriptions of Objectives and Processes of Mechanical Learning,"In [1], we introduced mechanical learning and proposed 2 approaches to mechanical learning. Here, we follow one such approach to well describe the objects and the processes of learning. We discuss 2 kinds of patterns: objective and subjective pattern. Subjective pattern is crucial for learning machine. We prove that for any objective pattern we can find a proper subjective pattern based upon least base patterns to express the objective pattern well. X-form is algebraic expression for subjective pattern. Collection of X-forms form internal representation space, which is center of learning machine. We discuss learning by teaching and without teaching. We define data sufficiency by X-form. We then discussed some learning strategies. We show, in each strategy, with sufficient data, and with certain capabilities, learning machine indeed can learn any pattern (universal learning machine). In appendix, with knowledge of learning machine, we try to view deep learning from a different angle, i.e. its internal representation space and its learning dynamics."
machine learning,A Comparison of First-order Algorithms for Machine Learning,"Using an optimization algorithm to solve a machine learning problem is one of mainstreams in the field of science. In this work, we demonstrate a comprehensive comparison of some state-of-the-art first-order optimization algorithms for convex optimization problems in machine learning. We concentrate on several smooth and non-smooth machine learning problems with a loss function plus a regularizer. The overall experimental results show the superiority of primal-dual algorithms in solving a machine learning problem from the perspectives of the ease to construct, running time and accuracy."
machine learning,Theoretical Impediments to Machine Learning With Seven Sparks from the   Causal Revolution,"Current machine learning systems operate, almost exclusively, in a statistical, or model-free mode, which entails severe theoretical limits on their power and performance. Such systems cannot reason about interventions and retrospection and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for strong AI. To achieve human level intelligence, learning machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal modeling."
machine learning,Model-Agnostic Interpretability of Machine Learning,"Understanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that addresses these challenges."
machine learning,The Top 10 Topics in Machine Learning Revisited: A Quantitative   Meta-Study,"Which topics of machine learning are most commonly addressed in research? This question was initially answered in 2007 by doing a qualitative survey among distinguished researchers. In our study, we revisit this question from a quantitative perspective. Concretely, we collect 54K abstracts of papers published between 2007 and 2016 in leading machine learning journals and conferences. We then use machine learning in order to determine the top 10 topics in machine learning. We not only include models, but provide a holistic view across optimization, data, features, etc. This quantitative approach allows reducing the bias of surveys. It reveals new and up-to-date insights into what the 10 most prolific topics in machine learning research are. This allows researchers to identify popular topics as well as new and rising topics for their research."
machine learning,Transfer Learning for Voice Activity Detection: A Denoising Deep Neural   Network Perspective,"Mismatching problem between the source and target noisy corpora severely hinder the practical use of the machine-learning-based voice activity detection (VAD). In this paper, we try to address this problem in the transfer learning prospective. Transfer learning tries to find a common learning machine or a common feature subspace that is shared by both the source corpus and the target corpus. The denoising deep neural network is used as the learning machine. Three transfer techniques, which aim to learn common feature representations, are used for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the transfer learning schemes on the mismatch problem."
machine learning,IoT Security Techniques Based on Machine Learning,"Internet of things (IoT) that integrate a variety of devices into networks to provide advanced and intelligent services have to protect user privacy and address attacks such as spoofing attacks, denial of service attacks, jamming and eavesdropping. In this article, we investigate the attack model for IoT systems, and review the IoT security solutions based on machine learning techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. We focus on the machine learning based IoT authentication, access control, secure offloading and malware detection schemes to protect data privacy. In this article, we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed to implement these machine learning based security schemes in practical IoT systems."
machine learning,Machine Learning of Phonologically Conditioned Noun Declensions For   Tamil Morphological Generators,"This paper presents machine learning solutions to a practical problem of Natural Language Generation (NLG), particularly the word formation in agglutinative languages like Tamil, in a supervised manner. The morphological generator is an important component of Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence. It generates word forms given a root and affixes. The morphophonemic changes like addition, deletion, alternation etc., occur when two or more morphemes or words joined together. The Sandhi rules should be explicitly specified in the rule based morphological analyzers and generators. In machine learning framework, these rules can be learned automatically by the system from the training samples and subsequently be applied for new inputs. In this paper we proposed the machine learning models which learn the morphophonemic rules for noun declensions from the given training data. These models are trained to learn sandhi rules using various learning algorithms and the performance of those algorithms are presented. From this we conclude that machine learning of morphological processing such as word form generation can be successfully learned in a supervised manner, without explicit description of rules. The performance of Decision trees and Bayesian machine learning algorithms on noun declensions are discussed."
machine learning,The Machine Learning Algorithm as Creative Musical Tool,"Machine learning is the capacity of a computational system to learn structures from datasets in order to make predictions on newly seen data. Such an approach offers a significant advantage in music scenarios in which musicians can teach the system to learn an idiosyncratic style, or can break the rules to explore the system's capacity in unexpected ways. In this chapter we draw on music, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to elucidate an understanding of machine learning algorithms as creative tools for music and the sonic arts. We motivate a new understanding of learning algorithms as human-computer interfaces. We show that, like other interfaces, learning algorithms can be characterised by the ways their affordances intersect with goals of human users. We also argue that the nature of interaction between users and algorithms impacts the usability and usefulness of those algorithms in profound ways. This human-centred view of machine learning motivates our concluding discussion of what it means to employ machine learning as a creative tool."
machine learning,Machine Learning for the Geosciences: Challenges and Opportunities,"Geosciences is a field of great societal relevance that requires solutions to several urgent problems facing our humanity and the planet. As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines."
machine learning,Evaluating Conditional Cash Transfer Policies with Machine Learning   Methods,"This paper presents an out-of-sample prediction comparison between major machine learning models and the structural econometric model. Over the past decade, machine learning has established itself as a powerful tool in many prediction applications, but this approach is still not widely adopted in empirical economic studies. To evaluate the benefits of this approach, I use the most common machine learning algorithms, CART, C4.5, LASSO, random forest, and adaboost, to construct prediction models for a cash transfer experiment conducted by the Progresa program in Mexico, and I compare the prediction results with those of a previous structural econometric study. Two prediction tasks are performed in this paper: the out-of-sample forecast and the long-term within-sample simulation. For the out-of-sample forecast, both the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the school attendance rates found by all machine learning models are smaller than those found by the structural model. Random forest and adaboost have the highest accuracy for the individual outcomes of all subgroups. For the long-term within-sample simulation, the structural model has better performance than do all of the machine learning models. The poor within-sample fitness of the machine learning model results from the inaccuracy of the income and pregnancy prediction models. The result shows that the machine learning model performs better than does the structural model when there are many data to learn; however, when the data are limited, the structural model offers a more sensible prediction. The findings of this paper show promise for adopting machine learning in economic policy analyses in the era of big data."

machine learning,Machine Teaching: A New Paradigm for Building Machine Learning Systems,"The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for machine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible.   While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of ""learners"", the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the ""teachers"". Machine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming languages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interaction and visualization.   In this paper, we present our position regarding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decoupling knowledge about machine learning algorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models."
machine learning,An efficient quantum algorithm for generative machine learning,"A central task in the field of quantum computing is to find applications where quantum computer could provide exponential speedup over any classical computer. Machine learning represents an important field with broad applications where quantum computer may offer significant speedup. Several quantum algorithms for discriminative machine learning have been found based on efficient solving of linear algebraic problems, with potential exponential speedup in runtime under the assumption of effective input from a quantum random access memory. In machine learning, generative models represent another large class which is widely used for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is exponentially more powerful to represent probability distributions compared with classical generative models and has exponential speedup in training and inference at least for some instances under a reasonable assumption in computational complexity theory. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine learning and offers a remarkable example in which a quantum algorithm shows exponential improvement over any classical algorithm in an important application field."
machine learning,Stealing Hyperparameters in Machine Learning,"Hyperparameters are critical in machine learning, as different hyperparameters often result in models with significantly different performance. Hyperparameters may be deemed confidential because of their commercial value and the confidentiality of the proprietary algorithms that the learner uses to learn them. In this work, we propose attacks on stealing the hyperparameters that are learned by a learner. We call our attacks hyperparameter stealing attacks. Our attacks are applicable to a variety of popular machine learning algorithms such as ridge regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, and neural network. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks both theoretically and empirically. For instance, we evaluate our attacks on Amazon Machine Learning. Our results demonstrate that our attacks can accurately steal hyperparameters. We also study countermeasures. Our results highlight the need for new defenses against our hyperparameter stealing attacks for certain machine learning algorithms."
machine learning,A Learning Algorithm for Relational Logistic Regression: Preliminary   Results,"Relational logistic regression (RLR) is a representation of conditional probability in terms of weighted formulae for modelling multi-relational data. In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm for RLR models. Learning an RLR model from data consists of two steps: 1- learning the set of formulae to be used in the model (a.k.a. structure learning) and learning the weight of each formula (a.k.a. parameter learning). For structure learning, we deploy Schmidt and Murphy's hierarchical assumption: first we learn a model with simple formulae, then more complex formulae are added iteratively only if all their sub-formulae have proven effective in previous learned models. For parameter learning, we convert the problem into a non-relational learning problem and use an off-the-shelf logistic regression learning algorithm from Weka, an open-source machine learning tool, to learn the weights. We also indicate how hidden features about the individuals can be incorporated into RLR to boost the learning performance. We compare our learning algorithm to other structure and parameter learning algorithms in the literature, and compare the performance of RLR models to standard logistic regression and RDN-Boost on a modified version of the MovieLens data-set."
machine learning,The Preference Learning Toolbox,"Preference learning (PL) is a core area of machine learning that handles datasets with ordinal relations. As the number of generated data of ordinal nature is increasing, the importance and role of the PL field becomes central within machine learning research and practice.

machine learning,On Fundamental Limits of Robust Learning,"We consider the problems of robust PAC learning from distributed and streaming data, which may contain malicious errors and outliers, and analyze their fundamental complexity questions. In particular, we establish lower bounds on the communication complexity for distributed robust learning performed on multiple machines, and on the space complexity for robust learning from streaming data on a single machine. These results demonstrate that gaining robustness of learning algorithms is usually at the expense of increased complexities. As far as we know, this work gives the first complexity results for distributed and online robust PAC learning."
machine learning,Neural Conditional Gradients,"The move from hand-designed to learned optimizers in machine learning has been quite successful for gradient-based and -free optimizers. When facing a constrained problem, however, maintaining feasibility typically requires a projection step, which might be computationally expensive and not differentiable. We show how the design of projection-free convex optimization algorithms can be cast as a learning problem based on Frank-Wolfe Networks: recurrent networks implementing the Frank-Wolfe algorithm aka. conditional gradients. This allows them to learn to exploit structure when, e.g., optimizing over rank-1 matrices. Our LSTM-learned optimizers outperform hand-designed as well learned but unconstrained ones. We demonstrate this for training support vector machines and softmax classifiers."
machine learning,Bridging belief function theory to modern machine learning,"Machine learning is a quickly evolving field which now looks really different from what it was 15 years ago, when classification and clustering were major issues. This document proposes several trends to explore the new questions of modern machine learning, with the strong afterthought that the belief function framework has a major role to play."

machine learning,On conditional parity as a notion of non-discrimination in machine   learning,"We identify conditional parity as a general notion of non-discrimination in machine learning. In fact, several recently proposed notions of non-discrimination, including a few counterfactual notions, are instances of conditional parity. We show that conditional parity is amenable to statistical analysis by studying randomization as a general mechanism for achieving conditional parity and a kernel-based test of conditional parity."

machine learning,Machine Learning with World Knowledge: The Position and Survey,"Machine learning has become pervasive in multiple domains, impacting a wide variety of applications, such as knowledge discovery and data mining, natural language processing, information retrieval, computer vision, social and health informatics, ubiquitous computing, etc. Two essential problems of machine learning are how to generate features and how to acquire labels for machines to learn. Particularly, labeling large amount of data for each domain-specific problem can be very time consuming and costly. It has become a key obstacle in making learning protocols realistic in applications. In this paper, we will discuss how to use the existing general-purpose world knowledge to enhance machine learning processes, by enriching the features or reducing the labeling work. We start from the comparison of world knowledge with domain-specific knowledge, and then introduce three key problems in using world knowledge in learning processes, i.e., explicit and implicit feature representation, inference for knowledge linking and disambiguation, and learning with direct or indirect supervision. Finally we discuss the future directions of this research topic."
machine learning,Generative Adversarial Learning for Spectrum Sensing,"A novel approach of training data augmentation and domain adaptation is presented to support machine learning applications for cognitive radio. Machine learning provides effective tools to automate cognitive radio functionalities by reliably extracting and learning intrinsic spectrum dynamics. However, there are two important challenges to overcome, in order to fully utilize the machine learning benefits with cognitive radios. First, machine learning requires significant amount of truthed data to capture complex channel and emitter characteristics, and train the underlying algorithm (e.g., a classifier). Second, the training data that has been identified for one spectrum environment cannot be used for another one (e.g., after channel and emitter conditions change). To address these challenges, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with deep learning structures is used to 1)~generate additional synthetic training data to improve classifier accuracy, and 2) adapt training data to spectrum dynamics. This approach is applied to spectrum sensing by assuming only limited training data without knowledge of spectrum statistics. Machine learning classifiers are trained with limited, augmented and adapted training data to detect signals. Results show that training data augmentation increases the classifier accuracy significantly and this increase is sustained with domain adaptation as spectrum conditions change."
machine learning,Quantum Learning Machine,"We propose a novel notion of a quantum learning machine for automatically controlling quantum coherence and for developing quantum algorithms. A quantum learning machine can be trained to learn a certain task with no a priori knowledge on its algorithm. As an example, it is demonstrated that the quantum learning machine learns Deutsch's task and finds itself a quantum algorithm, that is different from but equivalent to the original one."
machine learning,Learning Feature Hierarchies with Centered Deep Boltzmann Machines,"Deep Boltzmann machines are in principle powerful models for extracting the hierarchical structure of data. Unfortunately, attempts to train layers jointly (without greedy layer-wise pretraining) have been largely unsuccessful. We propose a modification of the learning algorithm that initially recenters the output of the activation functions to zero. This modification leads to a better conditioned Hessian and thus makes learning easier. We test the algorithm on real data and demonstrate that our suggestion, the centered deep Boltzmann machine, learns a hierarchy of increasingly abstract representations and a better generative model of data."
machine learning,Hyperparameter Search in Machine Learning,"We introduce the hyperparameter search problem in the field of machine learning and discuss its main challenges from an optimization perspective. Machine learning methods attempt to build models that capture some element of interest based on given data. Most common learning algorithms feature a set of hyperparameters that must be determined before training commences. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the resulting model's performance, but determining good values can be complex; hence a disciplined, theoretically sound search strategy is essential."
machine learning,Machine Learning for Machine Data from a CATI Network,"This is a machine learning application paper involving big data. We present high-accuracy prediction methods of rare events in semi-structured machine log files, which are produced at high velocity and high volume by NORC's computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) network for conducting surveys. We judiciously apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques and data-mining strategies to train effective learning and prediction models for classifying uncommon error messages in the log---without access to source code, updated documentation or dictionaries. In particular, our simple but effective approach of features preallocation for learning from imbalanced data coupled with naive Bayes classifiers can be conceivably generalized to supervised or semi-supervised learning and prediction methods for other critical events such as cyberattack detection."
machine learning,Sliced Wasserstein Kernels for Probability Distributions,"Optimal transport distances, otherwise known as Wasserstein distances, have recently drawn ample attention in computer vision and machine learning as a powerful discrepancy measure for probability distributions. The recent developments on alternative formulations of the optimal transport have allowed for faster solutions to the problem and has revamped its practical applications in machine learning. In this paper, we exploit the widely used kernel methods and provide a family of provably positive definite kernels based on the Sliced Wasserstein distance and demonstrate the benefits of these kernels in a variety of learning tasks. Our work provides a new perspective on the application of optimal transport flavored distances through kernel methods in machine learning tasks."
machine learning,Unifying distillation and privileged information,"Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and privileged information (Vapnik & Izmailov, 2015) are two techniques that enable machines to learn from other machines. This paper unifies these two techniques into generalized distillation, a framework to learn from multiple machines and data representations. We provide theoretical and causal insight about the inner workings of generalized distillation, extend it to unsupervised, semisupervised and multitask learning scenarios, and illustrate its efficacy on a variety of numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world data."
machine learning,Learning to Reason With Adaptive Computation,"Multi-hop inference is necessary for machine learning systems to successfully solve tasks such as Recognising Textual Entailment and Machine Reading. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive computation for learning the number of inference steps required for examples of different complexity and that learning the correct number of inference steps is difficult. We introduce the first model involving Adaptive Computation Time which provides a small performance benefit on top of a similar model without an adaptive component as well as enabling considerable insight into the reasoning process of the model."
machine learning,A Shared Task on Bandit Learning for Machine Translation,"We introduce and describe the results of a novel shared task on bandit learning for machine translation. The task was organized jointly by Amazon and Heidelberg University for the first time at the Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2017). The goal of the task is to encourage research on learning machine translation from weak user feedback instead of human references or post-edits. On each of a sequence of rounds, a machine translation system is required to propose a translation for an input, and receives a real-valued estimate of the quality of the proposed translation for learning. This paper describes the shared task's learning and evaluation setup, using services hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the data and evaluation metrics, and the results of various machine translation architectures and learning protocols."

We also present the novel continual learning method of incremental learning, where a challenging environment is solved using optimal weight initialization learned from first solving a similar easier environment. We show that incremental learning can produce vastly superior results than standard methods by providing a strong baseline method across ten Dex environments. We finally develop a saliency method for qualitative analysis of reinforcement learning, which shows the impact incremental learning has on network attention."
machine learning,Mutual learning in a tree parity machine and its application to   cryptography,"Mutual learning of a pair of tree parity machines with continuous and discrete weight vectors is studied analytically. The analysis is based on a mapping procedure that maps the mutual learning in tree parity machines onto mutual learning in noisy perceptrons. The stationary solution of the mutual learning in the case of continuous tree parity machines depends on the learning rate where a phase transition from partial to full synchronization is observed. In the discrete case the learning process is based on a finite increment and a full synchronized state is achieved in a finite number of steps. The synchronization of discrete parity machines is introduced in order to construct an ephemeral key-exchange protocol. The dynamic learning of a third tree parity machine (an attacker) that tries to imitate one of the two machines while the two still update their weight vectors is also analyzed. In particular, the synchronization times of the naive attacker and the flipping attacker recently introduced in [1] are analyzed. All analytical results are found to be in good agreement with simulation results."
machine learning,Benchmarking Machine Learning Technologies for Software Defect Detection,"Machine Learning approaches are good in solving problems that have less information. In most cases, the software domain problems characterize as a process of learning that depend on the various circumstances and changes accordingly. A predictive model is constructed by using machine learning approaches and classified them into defective and non-defective modules. Machine learning techniques help developers to retrieve useful information after the classification and enable them to analyse data from different perspectives. Machine learning techniques are proven to be useful in terms of software bug prediction. This study used public available data sets of software modules and provides comparative performance analysis of different machine learning techniques for software bug prediction. Results showed most of the machine learning methods performed well on software bug datasets."
machine learning,Indexing Cost Sensitive Prediction,"Predictive models are often used for real-time decision making. However, typical machine learning techniques ignore feature evaluation cost, and focus solely on the accuracy of the machine learning models obtained utilizing all the features available. We develop algorithms and indexes to support cost-sensitive prediction, i.e., making decisions using machine learning models taking feature evaluation cost into account. Given an item and a online computation cost (i.e., time) budget, we present two approaches to return an appropriately chosen machine learning model that will run within the specified time on the given item. The first approach returns the optimal machine learning model, i.e., one with the highest accuracy, that runs within the specified time, but requires significant up-front precomputation time. The second approach returns a possibly sub- optimal machine learning model, but requires little up-front precomputation time. We study these two algorithms in detail and characterize the scenarios (using real and synthetic data) in which each performs well. Unlike prior work that focuses on a narrow domain or a specific algorithm, our techniques are very general: they apply to any cost-sensitive prediction scenario on any machine learning algorithm."
machine learning,Identifying and Harnessing the Building Blocks of Machine Learning   Pipelines for Sensible Initialization of a Data Science Automation Tool,"As data science continues to grow in popularity, there will be an increasing need to make data science tools more scalable, flexible, and accessible. In particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work."
machine learning,Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Automated Machine Learning,"In order to achieve state-of-the-art performance, modern machine learning techniques require careful data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, given the ever increasing number of machine learning models being developed, model selection is becoming increasingly important. Automating the selection and tuning of machine learning pipelines consisting of data pre-processing methods and machine learning models, has long been one of the goals of the machine learning community. In this paper, we tackle this meta-learning task by combining ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian optimization. Using probabilistic matrix factorization techniques and acquisition functions from Bayesian optimization, we exploit experiments performed in hundreds of different datasets to guide the exploration of the space of possible pipelines. In our experiments, we show that our approach quickly identifies high-performing pipelines across a wide range of datasets, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art."

machine learning,Machine Learning with Guarantees using Descriptive Complexity and SMT   Solvers,"Machine learning is a thriving part of computer science. There are many efficient approaches to machine learning that do not provide strong theoretical guarantees, and a beautiful general learning theory. Unfortunately, machine learning approaches that give strong theoretical guarantees have not been efficient enough to be applicable. In this paper we introduce a logical approach to machine learning. Models are represented by tuples of logical formulas and inputs and outputs are logical structures. We present our framework together with several applications where we evaluate it using SAT and SMT solvers. We argue that this approach to machine learning is particularly suited to bridge the gap between efficiency and theoretical soundness. We exploit results from descriptive complexity theory to prove strong theoretical guarantees for our approach. To show its applicability, we present experimental results including learning complexity-theoretic reductions rules for board games. We also explain how neural networks fit into our framework, although the current implementation does not scale to provide guarantees for real-world neural networks."
machine learning,Feature Importance Measure for Non-linear Learning Algorithms,"Complex problems may require sophisticated, non-linear learning methods such as kernel machines or deep neural networks to achieve state of the art prediction accuracies. However, high prediction accuracies are not the only objective to consider when solving problems using machine learning. Instead, particular scientific applications require some explanation of the learned prediction function. Unfortunately, most methods do not come with out of the box straight forward interpretation. Even linear prediction functions are not straight forward to explain if features exhibit complex correlation structure.   In this paper, we propose the Measure of Feature Importance (MFI). MFI is general and can be applied to any arbitrary learning machine (including kernel machines and deep learning). MFI is intrinsically non-linear and can detect features that by itself are inconspicuous and only impact the prediction function through their interaction with other features. Lastly, MFI can be used for both --- model-based feature importance and instance-based feature importance (i.e, measuring the importance of a feature for a particular data point)."
machine learning,Meta-QSAR: a large-scale application of meta-learning to drug design and   discovery,"We investigate the learning of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) as a case-study of meta-learning. This application area is of the highest societal importance, as it is a key step in the development of new medicines. The standard QSAR learning problem is: given a target (usually a protein) and a set of chemical compounds (small molecules) with associated bioactivities (e.g. inhibition of the target), learn a predictive mapping from molecular representation to activity. Although almost every type of machine learning method has been applied to QSAR learning there is no agreed single best way of learning QSARs, and therefore the problem area is well-suited to meta-learning. We first carried out the most comprehensive ever comparison of machine learning methods for QSAR learning: 18 regression methods, 6 molecular representations, applied to more than 2,700 QSAR problems. (These results have been made publicly available on OpenML and represent a valuable resource for testing novel meta-learning methods.) We then investigated the utility of algorithm selection for QSAR problems. We found that this meta-learning approach outperformed the best individual QSAR learning method (random forests using a molecular fingerprint representation) by up to 13%, on average. We conclude that meta-learning outperforms base-learning methods for QSAR learning, and as this investigation is one of the most extensive ever comparisons of base and meta-learning methods ever made, it provides evidence for the general effectiveness of meta-learning over base-learning."
machine learning,Machine learning based hyperspectral image analysis: A survey,"Hyperspectral sensors enable the study of the chemical properties of scene materials remotely for the purpose of identification, detection, and chemical composition analysis of objects in the environment. Hence, hyperspectral images captured from earth observing satellites and aircraft have been increasingly important in agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, mining, and defense. Machine learning algorithms due to their outstanding predictive power have become a key tool for modern hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, a solid understanding of machine learning techniques have become essential for remote sensing researchers and practitioners. This paper reviews and compares recent machine learning-based hyperspectral image analysis methods published in literature. We organize the methods by the image analysis task and by the type of machine learning algorithm, and present a two-way mapping between the image analysis tasks and the types of machine learning algorithms that can be applied to them. The paper is comprehensive in coverage of both hyperspectral image analysis tasks and machine learning algorithms. The image analysis tasks considered are land cover classification, target detection, unmixing, and physical parameter estimation. The machine learning algorithms covered are Gaussian models, linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture model, latent linear models, sparse linear models, Gaussian mixture models, ensemble learning, directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, clustering, Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, and deep learning. We also discuss the open challenges in the field of hyperspectral image analysis and explore possible future directions."
machine learning,Temporal Autoencoding Restricted Boltzmann Machine,"Much work has been done refining and characterizing the receptive fields learned by deep learning algorithms. A lot of this work has focused on the development of Gabor-like filters learned when enforcing sparsity constraints on a natural image dataset. Little work however has investigated how these filters might expand to the temporal domain, namely through training on natural movies. Here we investigate exactly this problem in established temporal deep learning algorithms as well as a new learning paradigm suggested here, the Temporal Autoencoding Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TARBM)."
machine learning,A new approach in machine learning,"In this technical report we presented a novel approach to machine learning. Once the new framework is presented, we will provide a simple and yet very powerful learning algorithm which will be benchmark on various dataset.   The framework we proposed is based on booleen circuits; more specifically the classifier produced by our algorithm have that form. Using bits and boolean gates instead of real numbers and multiplication enable the the learning algorithm and classifier to use very efficient boolean vector operations. This enable both the learning algorithm and classifier to be extremely efficient. The accuracy of the classifier we obtain with our framework compares very favorably those produced by conventional techniques, both in terms of efficiency and accuracy."

With the advancement of Deep Learning algorithms, various successful feature learning techniques have evolved. In this paper, we present a novel way of learning discriminative features by training Deep Neural Nets which have Encoder or Decoder type architecture similar to an Autoencoder. We demonstrate that our approach can learn discriminative features which can perform better at pattern classification tasks when the number of training samples is relatively small in size."

This paper first gives an overview of deep learning and then provides a comprehensive survey of its current applications in sentiment analysis."

Xu, et al., (Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510,   2009, arXiv:0803.3490)","This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) [arXiv:0803.3490] by H. Xu, etc. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem."
machine learning,Kernel machines with two layers and multiple kernel learning,"In this paper, the framework of kernel machines with two layers is introduced, generalizing classical kernel methods. The new learning methodology provide a formal connection between computational architectures with multiple layers and the theme of kernel learning in standard regularization methods. First, a representer theorem for two-layer networks is presented, showing that finite linear combinations of kernels on each layer are optimal architectures whenever the corresponding functions solve suitable variational problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The input-output map expressed by these architectures turns out to be equivalent to a suitable single-layer kernel machines in which the kernel function is also learned from the data. Recently, the so-called multiple kernel learning methods have attracted considerable attention in the machine learning literature. In this paper, multiple kernel learning methods are shown to be specific cases of kernel machines with two layers in which the second layer is linear. Finally, a simple and effective multiple kernel learning method called RLS2 (regularized least squares with two layers) is introduced, and his performances on several learning problems are extensively analyzed. An open source MATLAB toolbox to train and validate RLS2 models with a Graphic User Interface is available."
machine learning,Contemporary machine learning: a guide for practitioners in the physical   sciences,"Machine learning is finding increasingly broad application in the physical sciences. This most often involves building a model relationship between a dependent, measurable output and an associated set of controllable, but complicated, independent inputs. We present a tutorial on current techniques in machine learning -- a jumping-off point for interested researchers to advance their work. We focus on deep neural networks with an emphasis on demystifying deep learning. We begin with background ideas in machine learning and some example applications from current research in plasma physics. We discuss supervised learning techniques for modeling complicated functions, beginning with familiar regression schemes, then advancing to more sophisticated deep learning methods. We also address unsupervised learning and techniques for reducing the dimensionality of input spaces. Along the way, we describe methods for practitioners to help ensure that their models generalize from their training data to as-yet-unseen test data. We describe classes of tasks -- predicting scalars, handling images, fitting time-series -- and prepare the reader to choose an appropriate technique. We finally point out some limitations to modern machine learning and speculate on some ways that practitioners from the physical sciences may be particularly suited to help."
machine learning,Learning to Learn Neural Networks,"Meta-learning consists in learning learning algorithms. We use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network to learn to compute on-line updates of the parameters of another neural network. These parameters are stored in the cell state of the LSTM. Our framework allows to compare learned algorithms to hand-made algorithms within the traditional train and test methodology. In an experiment, we learn a learning algorithm for a one-hidden layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on non-linearly separable datasets. The learned algorithm is able to update parameters of both layers and generalise well on similar datasets."
machine learning,Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data,"Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task)."
machine learning,Generalization in Machine Learning via Analytical Learning Theory,"This paper introduces a novel measure-theoretic learning theory to analyze generalization behaviors of practical interest. The proposed learning theory has the following abilities: 1) to utilize the qualities of each learned representation on the path from raw inputs to outputs in representation learning, 2) to guarantee good generalization errors possibly with arbitrarily rich hypothesis spaces (e.g., arbitrarily large capacity and Rademacher complexity) and non-stable/non-robust learning algorithms, and 3) to clearly distinguish each individual problem instance from each other. Our generalization bounds are relative to a representation of the data, and hold true even if the representation is learned. We discuss several consequences of our results on deep learning, one-shot learning and curriculum learning. Unlike statistical learning theory, the proposed learning theory analyzes each problem instance individually via measure theory, rather than a set of problem instances via statistics. Because of the differences in the assumptions and the objectives, the proposed learning theory is meant to be complementary to previous learning theory and is not designed to compete with it."
machine learning,Multi-View Factorization Machines,"For a learning task, data can usually be collected from different sources or be represented from multiple views. For example, laboratory results from different medical examinations are available for disease diagnosis, and each of them can only reflect the health state of a person from a particular aspect/view. Therefore, different views provide complementary information for learning tasks. An effective integration of the multi-view information is expected to facilitate the learning performance. In this paper, we propose a general predictor, named multi-view machines (MVMs), that can effectively include all the possible interactions between features from multiple views. A joint factorization is embedded for the full-order interaction parameters which allows parameter estimation under sparsity. Moreover, MVMs can work in conjunction with different loss functions for a variety of machine learning tasks. A stochastic gradient descent method is presented to learn the MVM model. We further illustrate the advantages of MVMs through comparison with other methods for multi-view classification, including support vector machines (SVMs), support tensor machines (STMs) and factorization machines (FMs)."
machine learning,Machine Learning: When and Where the Horses Went Astray?,"Machine Learning is usually defined as a subfield of AI, which is busy with information extraction from raw data sets. Despite of its common acceptance and widespread recognition, this definition is wrong and groundless. Meaningful information does not belong to the data that bear it. It belongs to the observers of the data and it is a shared agreement and a convention among them. Therefore, this private information cannot be extracted from the data by any means. Therefore, all further attempts of Machine Learning apologists to justify their funny business are inappropriate."

From this perspective, there exist glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to increase the impact that ML has?

electron,Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies,"The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations."
electron,Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate   electrons,We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.
electron,Electron pairing: from metastable electron pair to bipolaron,"Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation within electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average correlation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the crystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap. In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band."
electron,Hamiltonian of a many-electron system with single-electron and   electron-pair states in a two-dimensional periodic potential,"Based on the metastable electron-pair energy band in a two-dimensional (2D) periodic potential obtained previously by Hai and Castelano [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 26, 115502 (2014)], we present in this work a Hamiltonian of many electrons consisting of single electrons and electron pairs in the 2D system. The electron-pair states are metastable of energies higher than those of the single-electron states at low electron density. We assume two different scenarios for the single-electron band. When it is considered as the lowest conduction band of a crystal, we compare the obtained Hamiltonian with the phenomenological model Hamiltonian of a boson-fermion mixture proposed by Friedberg and Lee [Phys. Rev. B 40, 6745 (1989)]. Single-electron-electron-pair and electron-pair-electron-pair interaction terms appear in our Hamiltonian and the interaction potentials can be determined from the electron-electron Coulomb interactions. When we consider the single-electron band as the highest valence band of a crystal, we show that holes in this valence band are important for stabilization of the electron-pair states in the system."
electron,Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron   Flux Spectra in Solar Flares,"Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$ keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray spectrum steeper at high energies.   Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated electrons.   We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung. Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E = 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy exists."
electron,Improved scenario of baryogenesis,"It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry. Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference. At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as protons and electrons."
electron,Exact Electron-Pairing Ground States of Tight-Binding Models with Local   Attractive Interactions,"We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models exhibit an electron-pair condensation."
electron,Electron-electron interactions in a weakly screened two-dimensional   electron system,"We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on liquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both the independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interacting electron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drude theory as a function of electron density."
electron,Free-electron properties of metals under ultrafast laser-induced   electron-phonon nonequilibrium: A first-principles study,"The electronic behavior of various solid metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Au, Ti, and W) under ultrashort laser irradiation is investigated by means of density functional theory. Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecond time scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical coupling and transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the free-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter. However, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the electronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles calculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic temperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the concept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent free-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large range of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic temperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of transition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in localized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion effective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium density of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials, free-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures. Thus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as a base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of excitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action."
electron,First-principles calculations of hot-electron lifetimes in metals,"First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energy electrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates are evaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we compute within the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are then obtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full inclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also reported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the band structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller than those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in Be, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the density of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$ electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions yields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in a free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$) electrons."
electron,D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation for degenerate electrons in the   electron-hole liquid,"We present an analytical study of the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation time for degenerate electrons in a photo-excited electron-hole liquid in intrinsic semiconductors exhibiting a spin-split band structure. The D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole scattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and virtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions (one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective electron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin relaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to be comparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a common model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole pairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the scattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is predicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid. In the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model fails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free precession of individual quasiparticle spins."
electron,First-principles calculations of heat capacities of ultrafast   laser-excited electrons in metals,"Ultrafast laser excitation can induce fast increases of the electronic subsystem temperature. The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of band structure and energy distribution can determine the change of several thermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the electronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at finite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent on electronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including free electron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and correlation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic heat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases. Then, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the number of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be correctly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of localized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the electronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally excite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective excitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high temperature."
electron,"Born-Oppenheimer Dynamics, Electronic Friction, and the Inclusion of   Electron-Electron Interactions","We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a set of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of quantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the electronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our derivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the coupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation whereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear movement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce to previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e. Hamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is symmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we study electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper treatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo resonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate."
electron,Electronic Properties Of Buckminsterfullerenes: Degeneracies and   Surprises,"Buckminsterfullerene compounds exibit remarkable physics at low temperatures, e.g. high temperature superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes, and ferromagnetism in TDAE -C60. Here we review recent theoretical studies of electron correlations in these compounds. In particular, we discuss models of electron-vibron interactions, electron-electron interactions, and intermolecular hopping. We show that the origin of novel electronic phases lies in {\em local} degeneracies of C60; a direct consequence of the high molecular symmetry."
electron,Energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron liquid,"The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems is studied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation in which the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends on the electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rate is found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of the electron system."
electron,Shear viscosity of degenerate electron matter,We calculate the partial electron shear viscosity $\eta_{ee}$ limited by electron-electron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly suppresses $\eta_{ee}$ in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons and modifies its %asymptotic temperature behavior. The efficiency of the electron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars is analyzed.
electron,Plasmon-assisted electron-electron collisions at metallic surfaces,"We present a theoretical treatment for the ejection of a secondary electron from a clean metallic surface induced by the impact of a fast primary electron. Assuming a direct scattering between the incident, primary electron and the electron in a metal, we calculate the electron-pair energy distributions at the surfaces of Al and Be. Different models for the screening of the electron-electron interaction are examined and the footprints of the surface and the bulk plasmon modes are determined and analyzed. The formulated theoretical approach is compared with the available experimental data on the electron-pair emission from Al."
electron,Resonant electron-phonon-electron interaction,"The effect of the resonance of electron scattering energy difference and phonon energy on the electron-phonon-electron interaction (EPEI) is studied. Results show that the resonance of electron transition energy and phonon energy can enhance EPEI by a magnitude of 1 to 2. Moreover, the anisotropic S-wave electron or dx2-y2 electron can enhance resonance EPEI, and the self-energy correction of the electron will weaken resonance EPEI. Particularly, the asymmetrical spin-flip scattering process in k space can reduce the effect of electronic self-energy to enhance resonance EPEI"
electron,Electron-Phonon Scattering in Semiconductor Structures with   One-Dimensional Electron Gas,In this study a method for calculation of the electron-phonon scattering rate in semiconductor structures with one-dimensional electron gas is developed. The energy uncertainty of electrons is taken into account.
electron,On Unconventional Electron Pairing In a Periodic Potential,On the assumption that two electrons with the same group velocity effectively attract each other a simple model Hamiltonian is proposed to question the existence of unconventional electron pairs formed by electrons in a strong periodic potential.
electron,Spin polarization of electrons in quantum wires,The total energy of a quasi-one-dimensional electron system is calculated using density functional theory. It is shown that spontaneous ferromagnetic state in quantum wire occurs at low one-dimensional electron density. The critical electron density below which electrons are in spin-polarized state is estimated analytically.
electron,Electron Dynamics at a Positive Ion,"The dynamics of electrons in the presence of a positive ion is considered for conditions of weak electron-electron couping but strong electron-ion coupling. The equilibrium electron density and electric field time correlation functions are evaluated for semi-classical conditions using a classical statistical mechanics with a regularized electron-ion interaction for MD simulation. The theoretical analysis for the equilibrium state is obtained from the corresponding nonlinear Vlasov equation. Time correlation functions for the electrons are determined from the linearized Vlasov equation. The resulting electron dynamics is described in terms of a distribution of single electron-ion trajectories screened by an inhomogeneous electron gas dielectric function. The results are applied to calculation of the autocorrelation function for the electron electric field at the ion for $ 0\leq Z\leq 40$, including conditions of strong electron-ion coupling. The electron stopping power and self-diffusion coefficient are determined from these results, and all properties calculated are compared with those obtained from semi-classical molecular dynamics simulation. The agreement with semi-classical MD simulation is found to be reasonable. The theoretical description provides an instructive interpretation for the strong electron-ion results."
electron,Experimental Determination of Electron Transition Probabilities in   Elementary Electron-Phonon Scattering Processes Using Electron-Energy-Loss   Spectroscopy: The Example of Graphite,"We have investigated coupling constants in elementary electron-phonon scattering processes on a graphite surface by the combined use of high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and very low-energy electron diffraction (VLEED). HREELS is used to measure the modulations of electron transition probabilities from incoming electrons in vacuum to outgoing electrons in vacuum where the transition includes one-phonon scattering processes inside a solid. Determining the electronic band structures of graphite with VLEED, we defined electronic states of the solid surface that electrons entered before and after scattering off phonons. Thus, we observed that the measured electron transition probabilities significantly depended on whether the electrons were in a bulk Bloch state or an evanescent state before scattering off the phonons. This result clearly indicates that the measured electron transition probabilities reflect the strength of the coupling constants in the solid."
electron,Electrons surfing on a sound wave as a platform for quantum optics with   flying electrons,"Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that strongly interact with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation to perform quantum optics like experiments at the single electron level is therefore a challenging task. Up to date, only few experiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas where the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were detected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single electron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\mum/ns. When such a quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other, which is several micrometres apart, with a quantum efficiency of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T2* of GaAs spin qubits6. Our work opens new avenues to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed matter system."
electron,Electron--Electron Scattering in Quantum Wires and it's Possible   Suppression due to Spin Effects,"A microscopic picture of electron-electron pair scattering in single mode quantum wires is introduced which includes electron spin. A new source of `excess' noise for hot carriers is presented. We show that zero magnetic field `spin' splitting in quantum wires can lead to a dramatic `spin'-subband dependence of electron--electron scattering, including the possibility of strong suppression. As a consequence extremely long electron coherence lengths and new spin-related phenomena are predicted. Since electron bands in III-V semiconductor quantum wires are in general spin-split in zero applied magnetic field, these new transport effects are of general importance."
electron,Accounting for both electron--lattice and electron--electron coupling in   conjugated polymers: minimum total energy calculations on the   Hubbard--Peierls hamiltonian,"Minimum total energy calculations, which account for both electron--lattice and electron--electron interactions in conjugated polymers are performed for chains with up to eight carbon atoms. These calculations are motivated in part by recent experimental results on the spectroscopy of polyenes and conjugated polymers and shed light on the longstanding question of the relative importance of electron--lattice vs. electron--electron interactions in determining the properties of these systems."
electron,Periodic and Aperiodic Bunching in the Addition Spectra of Quantum Dot,"We study electron addition spectra of quantum dots in a broad range of electron occupancies starting from the first electron. Spectra for dots containing <200 electrons reveal a surprising feature. Electron additions are not evenly spaced in gate voltage. Rather, they group into bunches. With increasing electron number the bunching evolves from occurring randomly to periodically at about every fifth electron. The periodicity of the bunching and features in electron tunneling rates suggest that the bunching is associated with electron additions into spatially distinct regions within the dots."
electron,Nonlinear voltage dependence of the shot noise in mesoscopic degenerate   conductors with strong electron-electron scattering,"It is shown that measurements of zero-frequency shot-noise can provide information on electron-electron interaction, because the strong interaction results in the nonlinear voltage dependence of the shot noise in metallic wires. This is due to the fact that the Wiedemann-Franz law is no longer valid in the case of considerable electron-electron interaction. The deviations from this law increase the noise power and make it dependent strongly on the ratio of electron-electron and electron-impurity scattering rates."
electron,Polaron and bipolaron formation in the Hubbard-Holstein model: role of   next-nearest neighbor electron hopping,"The influence of next-nearest neighbor electron hopping, $t^{\prime}$, on the polaron and bipolaron formation in a square Hubbard-Holstein model is investigated within a variational approach. The results for electron-phonon and electron-electron correlation functions show that a negative value of $t^{\prime}$ induces a strong anisotropy in the lattice distortions favoring the formation of nearest neighbor intersite bipolaron. The role of $t^{\prime}$, electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions is briefly discussed in view of the formation of charged striped domains."
electron,Tunneling through an Aharonov-Bohm ring -- effects of dephasing by   electron-electron interactions,"We develop a non-perturbative numerical method to study a single electron tunneling through an Aharonov-Bohm ring in the presence of bound, interacting electrons. Inelastic processes and spin-flip scattering are properly taken into account. We show that electron-electron interactions described by the Hubbard Hamiltonian lead to strong dephasing and we obtain high transmission probability at Phi=pi even at small interaction strength. Depending on the many-electron state on the ring, dephasing can occur in elastic or inelastic channels with or without changing the spin of the scattering electron."
electron,Pairing in Cu-O Models: Clues of Joint Electron-Phonon and   Electron-Electron Interactions,"We discuss a many-electron Hamiltonian with Hubbard-like repulsive interaction and linear coupling to the phonon branches, having the Cu-O plane of the superconducting cuprates as a paradigm. A canonical transformation extracts an effective two-body problem from the many-body theory. As a prototype system we study the $\cu$ cluster, which yields electronic pairing in the Hubbard model; moreover, a standard treatment of the Jahn-Teller effect predicts distortions that destroy electronic pairing. Remarkably, calculations that keep all the electronic spectrum into account show that vibrations are likely to be synergic with electronic pairing, if the coupling to half-breathing modes predominates, as experiments suggest."
electron,Electron-electron scattering effects on the Full Counting Statistics of   Mesoscopic Conductors,"In the hot electron regime, electron-electron scattering strongly modifies not only the shot noise but also the full counting statistics. We employ a method based on a stochastic path integral to calculate the counting statistics of two systems in which noise in the hot electron regime has been experimentally measured. We give an analytical expression for the counting statistics of a chaotic cavity and find that heating due to electron-electron scattering renders the distribution of transmitted charge symmetric in the shot noise limit. We also discuss the frequency dispersion of the third order correlation function and present numerical calculations for the statistics of diffusive wires in the hot electron regime."
electron,Multi-Electron Production at High Transverse Momenta in ep Collisions at   HERA,"Multi-electron production is studied at high electron transverse momentum in positron- and electron-proton collisions using the H1 detector at HERA. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 115 pb-1. Di-electron and tri-electron event yields are measured. Cross sections are derived in a restricted phase space region dominated by photon-photon collisions. In general good agreement is found with the Standard Model predictions. However, for electron pair invariant masses above 100 GeV, three di-electron events and three tri-electron events are observed, compared to Standard Model expectations of 0.30 \pm 0.04 and 0.23 \pm 0.04, respectively."
electron,Temporary Acceleration of Electrons While Inside an Intense   Electromagnetic Pulse,"A free electron can temporarily gain a very significant amount of energy if it is overrun by an intense electromagnetic wave. In principle, this process would permit large enhancements in the center-of-mass energy of electron-electron, electron-positron and electron-photon interactions if these take place in the presence of an intense laser beam. Practical considerations severely limit the utility of this concept for contemporary lasers incident on relativistic electrons. A more accessible laboratory phenomenon is electron-positron production via an intense laser beam incident on a gas. Intense electromagnetic pulses of astrophysical origin can lead to very energetic photons via bremsstrahlung of temporarily accelerated electrons."
electron,Kink structure in the electronic dispersion of high-Tc superconductors   from the electron-phonon interaction,"We investigate the electronic dispersion of high-Tc superconductor on the basis of the two-dimensional three-band Hubbard model with the electron-phonon interaction together with the strong electron-electron interaction. In our model, it is shown across the hole-doped region of high-Tc superconductor that the electron-phonon interaction makes a dispersion kink, observed along the nodal direction, and that the small isotope effect appears on the electronic dispersion."
electron,Electron and phonon correlations in systems of one-dimensional electrons   coupled to phonons,"Electron and phonon correlations in systems of one-dimensional electrons coupled to phonons are studied at low temperatures by emphasizing on the effect of electron-phonon backward scattering. It is found that the $2k_F$-wave components of the electron density and phonon displacement field share the same correlations. Both correlations are quasi-long-ranged for a single conducting chain coupled to one-dimensional or three-dimensional phonons, and they are long-ranged for repulsive electron-electron interactions for a three-dimensional array of parallel one-dimensional conducting chains coupled to three-dimensional phonons."
electron,Ballistic Hot Electron Transport in Graphene,"We theoretically study the inelastic scattering rate and the carrier mean free path for energetic hot electrons in graphene, including both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. Taking account of optical phonon emission and electron-electron scattering, we find that the inelastic scattering time $\tau \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} \mathrm{ps}$ and the mean free path $l \sim 10-10^2 \mathrm{nm}$ for electron densities $n = 10^{12}-10^{13} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. In particular, we find that the mean free path exhibits a finite jump at the phonon energy $200 \mathrm{meV}$ due to electron-phonon interaction. Our results are directly applicable to device structures where ballistic transport is relevant with inelastic scattering dominating over elastic scattering."
electron,Spin dynamics of electrons in the first excited subband of a   high-mobility low-density 2D electron system,"We report on time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements of spin coherence of electrons in the first excited subband of a high-mobility low-density two-dimensional electron system in a GaAs/Al0.35Ga0.65As heterostructure. While the transverse spin lifetime (T2*) of electrons decreases monotonically with increasing magnetic field, it has a non-monotonic dependence on the temperature, with a peak value of 596 ps at 36 K, indicating the effect of inter-subband electron-electron scattering on the electron spin relaxation. The spin lifetime may be long enough for potential device application with electrons in excited subbands."
electron,Quantum description and properties of electrons emitted from pulsed   nanotip electron sources,We present a quantum calculation of the electron degeneracy for electron sources. We explore quantum interference of electrons in the temporal and spatial domain and demonstrate how it can be utilized to characterize a pulsed electron source. We estimate effects of Coulomb repulsion on two-electron interference and show that currently available nano tip pulsed electron sources operate in the regime where the quantum nature of electrons can be made dominant.
electron,Metastable electron-pair states in a two-dimensional crystal,"We study possible quantum states of two correlated electrons in a two-dimensional crystal and find a metastable energy band of the electron pair between the two lowest single-electron bands. These metastable states result from the interplay of electron correlations and the strength of the crystal potential. The two paired electrons are bound in the same unit cell in relative coordinates with an average distance between them about one third of the crystal period. Furthermore, we show how such electron-pairs can be stabilized in a many-electron system."
electron,Investigation of Vortex Structures in Gas-Discharge Nonneutral Electron   Plasma: III. Pulse Ejection of Electrons at the Formation and Radial   Oscillations of Vortex Structure,The results of experimental investigations of electron ejection from gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma at the formation and radial oscillations of vortex structure have been presented. The electrons are injected from the vortex structure and the adjacent region of electron sheath in the form of pulses the duration and periodicity of which are determined by the processes of evolution and dynamics of this structure. The possible mechanisms of pulse ejection of electrons are considered. The influence of electron ejection on other processes in discharge electron sheath is analyzed.
electron,Quasiparticle Mass Enhancement and Fermi Surface Shape Modification in   Oxide Two-Dimensional Electron Gases,"We propose a model intended to qualitatively capture the electron-electron interaction physics of two-dimensional electron gases formed near transition-metal oxide heterojunctions containing $t_{2g}$ electrons with a density much smaller than one electron per metal atom. Two-dimensional electron systems of this type can be described perturbatively using a $GW$ approximation which predicts that Coulomb interactions enhance quasiparticle effective masses more strongly than in simple two-dimensional electron gases, and that they reshape the Fermi surface, reducing its anisotropy."
electron,Some Aspects of Electron Dynamics in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion   Sources,"Electron dynamics in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source is numerically simulated by using Particle-In-Cell code combined with simulations of the ion dynamics. Mean electron energies are found to be around 70 keV close to values that are derived from spectra of X-ray emission out of the source. Electron life time is defined by losses of low-energy electrons created in ionizing collisions; the losses are regulated by electron heating rate, which depends on magnitude of the microwave electric field. Changes in ion confinement with variations in the microwave electric field and gas flow are simulated. Influence of electron dynamics on the afterglow and two-frequency heating effects is discussed."
electron,Wigner distributions for an electron,"We study the Wigner distributions for a physical electron, which reveal the multidimensional images of the electron. The physical electron is considered as a composite system of a bare electron and photon. The Wigner distributions for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized electron are presented in transverse momentum plane as well as in impact parameter plane. The spin-spin correlations between the bare electron and the physical electron are discussed. We also evaluate all the leading twist generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) for electron."
electron,Electron localization properties in high pressure hydrogen at the   liquid-liquid phase transition by Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo,"We analyze in detail the electronic properties of high pressure hydrogen around the liquid-liquid phase transition based on Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo calculations. Computing the off-diagonal single particle density matrix and the momentum distribution we discuss localization properties of the electrons. The abrupt changes of these distributions indicate a metal to insulator transition occurring together with the structural transition from the atomic to molecular fluid. We further discuss the electron-proton and electron-electron pair correlation functions, which also change abruptly at the transition."
electron,"Electron Multi-Beams (Electron Grids, Electron Lattices and Electron   Grates): New Elements for Accelerators","Since the initial proposal in 1990s, the method of electron lenses has been successfully developed and employed at the high energy particle colliders, like Tevatron and RHIC. Here we propose a new set of electron multi beam elements (electron grids, electron lattices, electron grates and other) which employ many beams in various spatial configurations, with possible time varying currents. We present major principles of operation and generation of such systems and briefly discuss a set of possible applications in accelerators."
electron,Effects of Electron-Electron Scattering on Electron-Beam Propagation in   a Two-Dimensional Electron-Gas,"We have studied experimentally and theoretically the influence of electron-electron collisions on the propagation of electron beams in a two-dimensional electron gas for excess injection energies ranging from zero up to the Fermi energy. We find that the detector signal consists of quasiballistic electrons, which either have not undergone any electron-electron collisions or have only been scattered at small angles. Theoretically, the small-angle scattering exhibits distinct features that can be traced back to the reduced dimensionality of the electron system. A number of nonlinear effects, also related to the two-dimensional character of the system, are discussed. In the simplest situation, the heating of the electron gas by the high-energy part of the beam leads to a weakening of the signal of quasiballistic electrons and to the appearance of thermovoltage. This results in a nonmonotonic dependence of the detector signal on the intensity of the injected beam, as observed experimentally."
electron,Effects of Electron-Electron and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Weakly   Disordered Conductors and Heterostuctures,"We investigate quantum corrections to the conductivity due to the interference of electron-electron (electron-phonon) scattering and elastic electron scattering in weakly disordered conductors. The electron-electron interaction results in a negative $T^2 \ln T$-correction in a 3D conductor. In a quasi-two-dimensional conductor, $d < v_F/T$ ($d$ is the thickness, $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity), with 3D electron spectrum this correction is linear in temperature and differs from that for 2D electrons (G. Zala et. al., Phys. Rev.B {\bf 64}, 214204 (2001)) by a numerical factor. In a quasi-one-dimensional conductor, temperature-dependent correction is proportional to $T^2$. The electron interaction via exchange of virtual phonons also gives $T^2$-correction. The contribution of thermal phonons interacting with electrons via the screened deformation potential results in $T^4$-term and via unscreened deformation potential results in $T^2$-term. The interference contributions dominate over pure electron-phonon scattering in a wide temperature range, which extends with increasing disorder."
electron,Why holes are not like electrons. II. The role of the electron-ion   interaction,"In recent work, we discussed the difference between electrons and holes in energy band in solids from a many-particle point of view, originating in the electron-electron interaction, and argued that it has fundamental consequences for superconductivity. Here we discuss the fact that there is also a fundamental difference between electrons and holes already at the single particle level, arising from the electron-ion interaction. The difference between electrons and holes due to this effect parallels the difference due to electron-electron interactions: {\it holes are more dressed than electrons}. We propose that superconductivity originates in 'undressing' of carriers from $both$ electron-electron and electron-ion interactions, and that both aspects of undressing have observable consequences."
electron,Density-matrix renormalization group study of pairing when   electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions coexist: effect of the   electronic band structure,"Density-matrix renormalization group is used to study the pairing when both of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are strong in the Holstein-Hubbard model at half-filling in a region intermediate between the adiabatic (Migdal's) and antiadiabatic limits. We have found: (i) the pairing correlation obtained for a one-dimensional system is nearly degenerate with the CDW correlation in a region where the phonon-induced attraction is comparable with the electron-electron repulsion, but (ii) pairing becomes dominant when we destroy the electron-hole symmetry in a trestle lattice. This provides an instance in which pairing can arise, in a lattice-structure dependent manner, from coexisting electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions."
electron,Tunable electron-electron interactions in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 nanostructures,"The interface between the two complex oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 has remarkable properties that can be locally reconfigured between conducting and insulating states using a conductive atomic force microscope. Prior investigations of sketched quantum dot devices revealed a phase in which electrons form pairs, implying a strongly attractive electron-electron interaction. Here, we show that these devices with strong electron-electron interactions can exhibit a gate-tunable transition from a pair-tunneling regime to a single-electron (Andreev bound state) tunneling regime where the interactions become repulsive. The electron-electron interaction sign change is associated with a Lifshitz transition where the dxz and dyz bands start to become occupied. This electronically tunable electron-electron interaction, combined with the nanoscale reconfigurability of this system, provides an interesting starting point towards solid-state quantum simulation."
electron,New many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes in a   two-dimensional crystal,"When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of individual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair states in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these electron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional square-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger than a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two lowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the many-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and may stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities in the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential and free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the charge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system."
electron,Suprathermal electron distributions in the solar transition region,"Suprathermal tails are a common feature of solar wind electron velocity distributions, and are expected in the solar corona. From the corona, suprathermal electrons can propagate through the steep temperature gradient of the transition region towards the chromosphere, and lead to non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with pronounced suprathermal tails. We calculate the evolution of a coronal electron distribution through the transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population there. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both ions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are Maxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid model. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of suprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the presence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs, starting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV, electrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free. The presence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs shows that the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not justified there. This has a significant impact on ionization dynamics, as is shown in a companion paper."
electron,Why holes are not like electrons. III. How holes in the normal state   turn into electrons in the superconducting state,"In recent work, we discussed the difference between electrons and holes in energy band in solids from a many-particle point of view, originating in the electron-electron interaction[1], and from a single particle point of view, originating in the electron-ion interaction[2]. We proposed that superconductivity in solids only occurs when the Fermi level is close to the top of a band (hole carriers), that it originates in `undressing' of carriers from $both$ the electron-electron and the electron-ion interaction, and that as a consequence holes in the normal state behave like electrons in the superconducting state[3]. However, the connection between both undressing effects was left unclear, as was left unclear how the transformation from hole behavior to electron behavior occurs. Here we clarify these questions by showing that the same electron-electron interaction physics that promotes pairing of hole carriers and undressing of carriers from the electron-electron interaction leads to undressing of carriers from the electron-ion interaction and transforms the behavior of carriers from hole-like to electron-like. Furthermore this phenomenon is connected with the expulsion of negative charge that we predict to occur in superconductors. These unexpected connections support the validity of our theoretical framework, the theory of hole superconductivity, to explain superconductivity in solids."
electron,Electron spin relaxation in graphene from a microscopic approach: Role   of electron-electron interaction,"Electron spin relaxation in graphene on a substrate is investigated from the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach. All the relevant scatterings, such as the electron-impurity, electron--acoustic-phonon, electron--optical-phonon, electron--remote-interfacial-phonon, as well as electron-electron Coulomb scatterings, are explicitly included. Our study concentrates on clean intrinsic graphene, where the spin-orbit coupling from the adatoms can be neglected. We discuss the effect of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction on spin relaxation under various conditions. It is shown that the electron-electron Coulomb scattering plays an important role in spin relaxation at high temperature. We also find a significant increase of the spin relaxation time for high spin polarization even at room temperature, which is due to the Coulomb Hartree-Fock contribution-induced effective longitudinal magnetic field. It is also discovered that the spin relaxation time increases with the in-plane electric field due to the hot-electron effect, which is different from the non-monotonic behavior in semiconductors. Moreover, we show that the electron-electron Coulomb scattering in graphene is not strong enough to establish the steady-state hot-electron distribution in the literature and an alternative approximate one is proposed based on our computation."
electron,"Electron loss from hydrogen-like highly charged ions in collisions with   electrons, protons and light atoms","We study electron loss from a hydrogen-like highly charged ion by the impact of equivelocity electrons and protons and also in collisions with hydrogen and helium. The collision velocity $v$ varies between $v_{min}$ and $v_{max}$, where $v_{min}$ and $v_{max}$ correspond to the energy threshold $\varepsilon_{th}$ for electron loss in collisions with a free electron and to $\approx 5 \, \varepsilon_{th}$, respectively. Our results show that in this range of $v$: i) compared to equivelocity electrons protons are more effective in inducing electron loss (due to a substantially larger volume of the effectively available final-state electron momentum space), ii) the relative (compared to protons) effectiveness of electron projectiles grows with increase in the atomic number of a highly charged ion, iii) a substantial part of the volume of the final-state-electron momentum space, kinematically available in collisions with electrons, is weaker populated in collisions with protons than with electrons, iv) even when the total loss cross sections in collisions with electrons and protons become already equal the spectra of the outgoing electrons still remain quite different in almost the entire volume of the final-state-electron momentum space. The points i) and iii), in particular, mean that in collisions with hydrogen target the contributions to the loss process from the interactions with the nucleus and the electron(s) of the atom would be to a large extent separated in the final-state-electron momentum space."
electron,Addition energies of a Quantum Dot with harmonic electron-electron   interactions,We study a two dimensional electron system in a parabolic confining potential and constant magnetic field for the case of harmonic electron-electron interaction. We present analytic results for the electrochemical potential versus magnetic field and discuss the effects of correlation in connection with the addition energy of a Quantum Dot with few electrons.
electron,Conductivity of the classical two-dimensional electron gas,We discuss the applicability of the Boltzmann equation to the classical two-dimensional electron gas. We show that in the presence of both the electron-impurity and electron-electron scattering the Boltzmann equation can be inapplicable and the correct result for conductivity can be different from the one obtained from the kinetic equation by a logarithmically large factor.
electron,Electronic properties of structural twin and antiphase boundaries in   materials with strong electron-lattice couplings,"Using a symmetry-based atomic scale theory of lattice distortions, we demonstrate that elastic textures, such as twin and antiphase boundaries, can generate intricate electronic inhomogeneities in materials with strong electron-lattice coupling, as observed in perovskite manganites and other functional materials."
electron,Restoration of Many Electron Wave Functions from One-Electron Density,General theorem describing a relation between diagonal of one-electron density matrix and a certain class of many-electron ensembles of determinant states is proved. As a corollary to this theorem a constructive proof of sufficiency of Coleman's representability conditions is obtained. It is shown that there exist rigorous schemes for construction of energy of many-electron system as functionals of one-electron density.
electron,Electronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor   Mg10Ir19B16,"Electronic structure of a novel superconducting noncentrosymmetric compound Mg10Ir19B16 was calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Electronic part of the electron-phonon coupling constant, McMillan-Hopfield parameters, were calculated using the rigid-muffin-tin approximation (RMTA). The magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling constant, analysing atomic contributions, is discussed. Our results show, that superconductivity in Mg10Ir19B16 is presumably mediated by electron-phonon interaction."
electron,An electronic radiation of blackbody: Cosmic electron background,"The Universe owns the electronic radiation of blackbody at temperature 2.725 K, which we call the cosmic electron background. We calculate its radiation spectrum. The energy distribution of number density of electrons in the cosmic electron background becomes zero as energy goes to both zero and infinity. It has one maximum peak near the energy level of 10**(-23) J."
electron,How do we interrogate the electrons without roughing them up?,"Electrons are indistinguishable, but the energy of each electron is different in different materials and if we can exploit this energy, then we can systematically study the changes of electronic properties in non free-electron metals."
electron,Wavefunctions for large systems as basis for electronic structure   calculations,"Electronic structure calculations for solids based on many-electron wavefunctions have been hampered by the argument that for large electron numbers wavefunctions are not a legitimate scientific concept, because they face an exponential wall problem. We show that this problem can be avoided by using cumulant techniques in formulating wavefunctions. Therefore calculations for solids based on many-electron functions are possible and useful. This includes also systems with strongly correlated electrons."
electron,On the emission of the fast $-$electrons during nuclear   $_^{-}$-decay in few-electron atoms,We discuss a possibility to observe fast secondary electrons ($\delta-$electrons) during nuclear $\beta^{-}$-decay in few-electron atoms and ions. Formulas for the corresponding probabilities and explicit expression for the energy spectrum of $\delta-$electrons are derived in the closed analytical forms.
electron,Optical properties of charged quantum dots doped with a single magnetic   impurity,"We present a microscopic theory of the optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots doped with a single magnetic manganese (Mn) impurity and containing a controlled number of electrons. The single-particle electron and heavy-hole electronic shells are described by two-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The electron-electron, electron-hole Coulomb as well as the short-range electron spin-Mn spin and hole spin-Mn spin contact exchange interactions are included. The electronic states of the photo-excited electron-hole-Mn complex and of the final electron-Mn complex are expanded in a finite number of configurations and the full interacting Hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically. The emission spectrum is predicted as a function of photon energy for a given number of electrons and different number of confined electronic quantum dot shells. We show how emission spectra allow to identify the number of electronic shells, the number of electrons populating these shells and, most importantly, their spin. We show that electrons not interacting directly with the spin of Mn ion do so via electron-electron interactions. This indirect interaction is a strong effect even when Mn impurity is away from the quantum dot center."
electron,Sculpturing the Electron Wave Function,"Coherent electrons such as those in electron microscopes, exhibit wave phenomena and may be described by the paraxial wave equation. In analogy to light-waves, governed by the same equation, these electrons share many of the fundamental traits and dynamics of photons. Today, spatial manipulation of electron beams is achieved mainly using electrostatic and magnetic fields. Other demonstrations include simple phase-plates and holographic masks based on binary diffraction gratings. Altering the spatial profile of the beam may be proven useful in many fields incorporating phase microscopy, electron holography, and electron-matter interactions. These methods, however, are fundamentally limited due to energy distribution to undesired diffraction orders as well as by their binary construction. Here we present a new method in electron-optics for arbitrarily shaping of electron beams, by precisely controlling an engineered pattern of thicknesses on a thin-membrane, thereby molding the spatial phase of the electron wavefront. Aided by the past decade's monumental leap in nano-fabrication technology and armed with light-optic's vast experience and knowledge, one may now spatially manipulate an electron beam's phase in much the same way light waves are shaped simply by passing them through glass elements such as refractive and diffractive lenses. We show examples of binary and continuous phase-plates and demonstrate the ability to generate arbitrary shapes of the electron wave function using a holographic phase-mask. This opens exciting new possibilities for microscopic studies of materials using shaped electron beams and enables electron beam lithography without the need to move the electron beam or the sample, as well as high resolution inspection of electronic chips by structured electron illumination."
electron,Pair emission from bare magnetized strange stars,"The dominant emission from bare strange stars is thought to be electron-positron pairs, produced through spontaneous pair creation (SPC) in a surface layer of electrons tied to the star by a superstrong electric field. The positrons escape freely, but the electrons are directed towards the star and quickly fill all available states, such that their degeneracy suppresses further SPC. An electron must be reflected and gain energy in order to escape, along with the positron. Each escaping electron leaves a hole that is immediately filled by another electron through SPC. We discuss the collisional processes that produce escaping electrons. When the Landau quantization of the motion perpendicular to the magnetic field is taken into account, electron-electron collisions can lead to an escaping electron only through a multi-stage process involving higher Landau levels. Although the available estimates of the collision rate are deficient in several ways, it appears that the rate is too low for electron-electron collisions to be effective. A simple kinetic model for electron-quark collisions leads to an estimate of the rate of pair production that is analogous to thermionic emission, but the work function is poorly determined."
electron,Nonequilibrium total dielectric function approach to the electron   Boltzmann equation for inelastic scattering in doped polar semiconductors,"This paper describes a simple and general method for deriving the inelastic collision term in the electron Boltzmann equation for scattering from a coupled electron-phonon system, and applies the method to the case of doped polar semiconductors. In the Born approximation, the inelastic differential scattering rate $W^{inel}$ can be expressed in terms of the nonequilibrium total dynamic dielectric function, which includes both electronic and lattice contributions. Within the random-phase approximation $W^{inel}$ separates into two components: an electron-electron interaction containing the nonequilibrium distribution function for excitations of the electron gas, and a Fr\""{o}hlich interaction including the phonon distribution function and self-energy due to polarization of the electrons. Each of these two interactions is screened by only the electronic part of the total dielectric function which contains the high frequency dielectric constant, unlike commonly used expressions which contain the static dielectric constant. Detailed balance between plasmons and electron-hole pairs in steady state is used to eliminate the nonequilibrium plasmon distribution from the Boltzmann equation, resulting in a dynamically screened electron-electron collision term. The phonon self-energy modifies the longitudinal optical phonon dispersion so that two hybrid normal modes contribute to the electron-phonon collision term."
electron,Dynamic correlations in symmetric electron-electron and electron-hole   bilayers,"The ground-state behavior of the symmetric electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers is studied by including dynamic correlation effects within the quantum version of Singwi, Tosi, Land, and Sjolander (qSTLS) theory. The static pair-correlation functions, the local-field correction factors, and the ground-state energy are calculated over a wide range of carrier density and layer spacing. The possibility of a phase transition into a density-modulated ground state is also investigated. Results for both the electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers are compared with those of recent diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulation studies. We find that the qSTLS results differ markedly from those of the conventional STLS approach and compare in the overall more favorably with the DMC predictions. An important result is that the qSTLS theory signals a phase transition from the liquid to the coupled Wigner crystal ground state, in both the electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers, below a critical density and in the close proximity of layers (d <~ r_sa_0^*), in qualitative agreement with the findings of the DMC simulations."
electron,Effect of the Coulomb interaction on the electron relaxation of   weakly-confined quantum dot systems,"We study acoustic-phonon-induced relaxation of charge excitations in single and tunnel-coupled quantum dots containing few confined interacting electrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for the electron-electron repulsion. Electron-phonon interaction is accounted for through both deformation potential and piezoelectric field mechanisms. We show that electronic correlations generally reduce intradot and interdot transition rates with respect to corresponding single-electron transitions, but this effect is lessened by external magnetic fields. On the other hand, piezoelectric field scattering is found to become the dominant relaxation mechanism as the number of confined electrons increases. Previous proposals to strongly suppress electron-phonon coupling in properly designed single-electron quantum dots are shown to hold also in multi-electron devices. Our results indicate that few-electron orbital degrees of freedom are more stable than single-electron ones."
electron,Study of charge-charge coupling effects on dipole emitter relaxation   within a classical electron-ion plasma description,"Studies of charge-charge (ion-ion, ion-electron, and electron-electron) coupling properties for ion impurities in an electron gas and for a two component plasma are carried out on the basis of a regularized electron-ion potential without short-range Coulomb divergence. This work is motivated in part by questions arising from recent spectroscopic measurements revealing discrepancies with present theoretical descriptions. Many of the current radiative property models for plasmas include only single electron-emitter collisions and neglect some or all charge-charge interactions. A molecular dynamics simulation of dipole relaxation is proposed here to allow proper account of many electron-emitter interactions and all charge-charge couplings. As illustrations, molecular dynamics simulations are reported for the cases of a single ion imbedded in an electron plasma and for a two-component ion-electron plasma. Ion-ion, electron-ion, and electron-electron coupling effects are discussed for hydrogen-like Balmer alpha lines."
electron,Kinetic Theory for Electron Dynamics Near a Positive Ion,"A theoretical description of time correlation functions for electron properties in the presence of a positive ion of charge number Z is given. The simplest case of an electron gas distorted by a single ion is considered. A semi-classical representation with a regularized electron - ion potential is used to obtain a linear kinetic theory that is asymptotically exact at short times. This Markovian approximation includes all initial (equilibrium) electron - electron and electron - ion correlations through renormalized pair potentials. The kinetic theory is solved in terms of single particle trajectories of the electron - ion potential and a dielectric function for the inhomogeneous electron gas. The results are illustrated by a calculation of the autocorrelation function for the electron field at the ion. The dependence on charge number Z is shown to be dominated by the bound states of the effective electron - ion potential. On this basis, a very simple practical representation of the trajectories is proposed and shown to be accurate over a wide range including strong electron - ion coupling. This simple representation is then used for a brief analysis of the dielectric function for the inhomogeneous electron gas."
electron,Interpolative approach for electron-electron and electron-phonon   interactions: from the Kondo to the polaronic regime,We present a theoretical approach to determine the electronic properties of nanoscale systems exhibiting strong electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions and coupled to metallic electrodes. This approach is based on an interpolative ansatz for the electronic self-energy which becomes exact both in the limit of weak and strong coupling to the electrodes. The method provides a generalization of previous interpolative schemes which have been applied to the purely electronic case extensively. As a test case we consider the single level Anderson-Holstein model. The results obtained with the interpolative ansatz are in good agreement with existing data from Numerical Renormalization Group calculations. We also check our results by considering the case of the electrodes represented by a few discrete levels which can be diagonalized exactly. The approximation describes properly the transition from the Kondo regime where electron-electron interactions dominate to the polaronic case characterized by a strong electron-phonon interaction.
electron,Simulation of electron transport in electron beam induced deposition of   nanostructures,"We present a numerical investigation of energy and charge distributions during electron-beam-induced growth of W nanostructures on SiO2 substrates using Monte Carlo simulation of electron transport. This study gives a quantitative insight into the deposition of energy and charge in the substrate and in already existing metallic nanostructures in the presence of the electron beam. We analyze electron trajectories, inelastic mean free paths, and distribution of backscattered electrons in different deposit compositions and depths. We find that, while in the early stages of the nanostructure growth a significant fraction of electron trajectories still interact with the substrate, as the nanostructure becomes thicker the transport takes place almost exclusively in the nanostructure. In particular, a larger deposit density leads to enhanced electron backscattering. This work shows how mesoscopic radiation-transport techniques can contribute to a model which addresses the multi-scale nature of the electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) process. Furthermore, similar simulations can aid in understanding the role played by backscattered electrons and emitted secondary electrons in the change of structural properties of nanostructured materials during post-growth electron-beam treatments."
electron,Interplay between electron-electron and electron-vibration interactions   on the thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions,"The linear thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions are theoretically studied close to room temperature within a model including electron-electron and electron-vibration interactions on the molecule. A nonequilibrium adiabatic approach is generalized to include large Coulomb repulsion through a self-consistent procedure and applied to the investigation of large molecules, such as fullerenes, within the Coulomb blockade regime. The focus is on the phonon thermal conductance which is quite sensitive to the effects of strong electron-electron interactions within the intermediate electron-vibration coupling regime. The electron-vibration interaction enhances the phonon and electron thermal conductance, and it reduces the charge conductance and the thermopower inducing a decrease of the thermoelectric figure of merit. For realistic values of junction parameters, the peak values of the thermoelectric figure of merit are still of the order of unity since the phonon thermal conductance can be even smaller than the electron counterpart."
electron,Graphene Electronic Structure in Charge Density Waves,"We introduce the idea that the electronic band structure of a charge density wave system may mimic the electronic structure of graphene. In that case a class of materials quite different from graphene might be opened up to exploit graphene's remarkable electronic properties. The theory of such materials, along with superconductivity, is based on the material's dynamical, rather than its static, properties. The charge density wave system turns out to have a number of requirements: (1) a specific wave geometry simply related to graphene; (2) a self-consistency among the electrons that requires the net Coulomb and phonon-mediated parts of the electron-electron interactions to be attractive. We develop a model that leads to an analytical expression for the total energy in terms of the effective electron mass $\mu$, the electron density $\rho_0$, and the strength $\tilde{\nu}_{K}$ of the net electron-electron interaction. For constant $\mu>0$ and $\rho_0$, we examine the limitations set upon $\tilde{\nu}_{K}$ by self-consistency, stability, and the approximation in the electronic state calculation, and find them to be mutually compatible. This demonstrates the viability of our model."
electron,Electron Driven Mobility Model by Light on the Stacked   Metal-Dielectric-Interfaces,"An electron mobility enhancement is the very important phenomenon of an electron in the electronic device, where the high electronic device performance has the good electron mobility, which is obtained by the overall electron drift velocity in the electronic material driven potential difference. The increasing in electron mobility by the injected high group velocity pulse is proposed in this article. By using light pulse input into the nonlinear microring resonator, light pulse group velocity can be tuned and increased, from which the required output group velocity can be obtained, which can be used to drive electron within the plasmonic waveguide, where eventually, the relative electron mobility can be obtained, the increasing in the electron mobility after adding up by the driven optical fields can be connected to the external electronic devices and circuits, which can be useful for many applications."
electron,Electron-electron attraction in an engineered electromechanical system,"Two electrons in a quantum dot repel each other: their interaction can be characterized by a positive interaction energy. From the theory of superconductivity, we also know that mechanical vibrations of the crystal lattice can make the electron-electron interaction attractive. Analogously, if a quantum dot interacts with a mechanical degree of freedom, the effective interaction energy can be negative; that is, the electron-electron interaction might be attractive. In this work, we propose and theoretically study an engineered electromechanical system that exhibits electron-electron attraction: a quantum dot suspended on a nonlinear mechanical resonator, tuned by a bottom and a top gate electrode. We focus on the example of a dot embedded in a suspended graphene ribbon, for which we identify conditions for electron-electron attraction. Our results suggest the possibility of electronic transport via tunneling of packets of multiple electrons in such devices, similar to that in superconducting nanostructures, but without the use of any superconducting elements."
electron,Role of f electrons in rare-earth and uranium intermetallics-An   alternative look at heavy-fermion phenomena,The understanding of magnetic and electronic properties of rare-earth intermetallics is summarized. The properties of NdNi5 or ErNi5 are understood by considering a few electronic subsystems like the f electronic subsystem and the conduction-electron subsystem. The localized f electrons can give a substantial contribution to the low temperature specific heat with the entropy of R ln2 in case of Kramers ions. In this view the heavy-fermion behaviour is related with the removal of the Kramers degeneracy of the ground state of the f electronic subsystem.
electron,The Localization-Delocalization Transition in Quantum Dots,"Single-electron capacitance spectroscopy precisely measures the energies required to add individual electrons to a quantum dot. The spatial extent of electronic wavefunctions is probed by investigating the dependence of these energies on changes in the dot confining potential. For low electron densities, electrons occupy distinct spatial sites localized within the dot. At higher densities, the electrons become delocalized, and all wavefunctions are spread over the full dot area. Near the delocalization transition, the last remaining localized states exist at the perimeter of the dot. Unexpectedly, these electrons appear to bind with electrons in the dot center."
electron,Femtosecond to picosecond electron-energy relaxation and Froehlich   coupling in quantum dots,"Electron relaxation in quantum dots is studied theoretically in polar semiconductor materials, with an emphasis put on the phonon-bottleneck problem and electron-LO-phonon coupling. The theory is based on multiphonon states of the electron-LO-phonon system and the self-consistent Tamm-Dancoff approximation is used for the electronic self-energy. Electronic relaxation rate is shown numerically to be on the scale from hundreds fs to tens ps, for electron energy-level separations being in the broad range from about one LO-phonon energy to about three or four optical-phonon energies. Despite of displaying some resonance features, the electronic relaxation rate does not appear to be crucially dependent on the quantum dot size."
electron,Instanton method for the electron propagator,"A nonperturbative theory of the electron propagator is developed and used to calculate the one-particle Green's function and tunneling density-of-states in strongly correlated electron systems. The method, which is based on a Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling of the electron-electron interaction combined with a cumulant expansion of the resulting noninteracting propagator, provides a possible generalization of the instanton technique to the calculation of the electron propagator in a many-body system. Application to the one-dimensional electron gas with short-range interaction is discussed."
electron,Cyclotron Resonance of Wigner Crystals on Liquid Helium,"The cyclotron resonance of the correlated two-dimentional electrons on liquid helium in high magnetic fields is investigated on the basis of the newly developed theory. Electrons are assumed to form a Wigner crystal, and the electron correlation effect is taken into account through the self-consistently determined Wigner phonons, where the electron-electron interaction, the electron-ripplon and electron-vapor atom scatterings are considered on the same footing. The numerical calculations show a very good agreement with experiments without any fitting parameters."
electron,Phase Diagram of the Holstein-Hubbard Two-Leg Ladder,"Using a functional renormalization group method, we obtain the phase diagram of the two-leg ladder system within the Holstein-Hubbard model, which includes both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. Our renormalization group technique allows us to analyze the problem for both weak and strong electron-phonon coupling. We show that, in contrast results from conventional weak coupling studies, electron-phonon interactions can dominate electron-electron interactions because of retardation effects."
electron,Local electron heating in nanoscale conductors,"The electron current density in nanoscale junctions is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding one in bulk electrodes. Consequently, the electron-electron scattering rate increases substantially in the junction. This leads to local electron heating of the underlying Fermi sea in analogy to the local ionic heating that is due to the increased electron-phonon scattering rates. We predict the bias dependence of local electron heating in quasi-ballistic nanoscale conductors, its effect on ionic heating, and discuss possible experimental tests of our results."
electron,The effect of electron-electron interactions on the conditions of   surface state existence,"Electronic surface states in one-dimensional two-band TBA model are studied by use of the Green function method. The local density of states (LDOS) at successive atoms in a semi-infinite chain, even in the case of atoms distant from the surface, is found to be clearly different from that observed in an unperturbed (infinite) chain. The surface atom occupancy is calculated self-consistently, with the effect of electron-electron interactions taken into account. The electron-electron interactions are shown to have a significant impact on the conditions of surface state existence."
electron,Nuclear spin ferromagnetic phase transition in an interacting 2D   electron gas,"Electrons in a two-dimensional semiconducting heterostructure interact with nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Using a a Kondo lattice formulation of the electron-nuclear spin interaction, we show that the nuclear spin system within an interacting two-dimensional electron gas undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at finite temperatures. We find that electron-electron interactions and non-Fermi liquid behavior substantially enhance the nuclear spin Curie temperature into the $mK$ range with decreasing electron density."
electron,The relevance of the vertex bremsstrahlung photon detection in the   electron-neutrino (antineutrino) electron scattering experiments at low   energy,"We discuss the size of the electron-antineutrino electron into electron-antineutrino electron cross section reduction due to the rejection of the events with a vertex bremsstrahlung photon above a certain energy in the final state. In particular we analyze the effect in experiments designed to detect the low energy electron-antineutrino and electron-neutrino from a nuclear reactor and from the Sun. We find that such reduction has to be considered in a relatively high statistic reactor experiment, while it is negligible for pp and 7Be solar neutrino detection."
electron,Nuclear Moments and Electron Density Functionals in Atoms,"An electron density functional approach for the calculation of the nuclear multipole moments is presented. The electronic matrix elements entering the experimentally observed hyperfine electron-nucleus interaction constants in atoms are expressed in terms of the electron density functionals of the charge or spin distributions. In principle, the construction of the charge or spin distribution density functionals can be obtained by means of every relativistic or non-relativistic quantum-mechanical or DFT method. The electronic matrix elements for all the electronic operators of the existing Hamiltonians of hyperfine electron-nuclear interactions are considered."
electron,Nonequilibrium Electron Interactions in Metal Films,"Ultrafast relaxation dynamics of an athermal electron distribution is investigated in silver films using a femtosecond pump-probe technique with 18 fs pulses in off-resonant conditions. The results yield evidence for an increase with time of the electron-gas energy loss rate to the lattice and of the free electron damping during the early stages of the electron-gas thermalization. These effects are attributed to transient alterations of the electron average scattering processes due to the athermal nature of the electron gas, in agreement with numerical simulations."
electron,Classical Trajectory Diagnosis of Finger-Like Pattern in the Correlated   Electron Momentum Distribution for Helium Double Ionization,"With a semiclassical quasistatic model we identify the distinct roles of nuclear Coulomb attraction, final state electron repulsion and electron-field interaction in forming the finger-like (or V-shaped) pattern in the correlated electron momentum distribution for Helium double ionization [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{99}, 263002; \emph{ibid}, 263003 (2007)]. The underlying microscopic trajectory configurations responsible for asymmetric electron energy sharing after electron-electron collision have been uncovered and corresponding sub-cycle dynamics are analyzed. The correlation pattern is found to be sensitive to the transverse momentum of correlated electrons."
electron,Charge instabilities and electron-phonon interaction in the   Hubbard-Holstein model,"We consider the Hubbard-Holstein model in the adiabatic limit to investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on the electron-phonon coupling. To this aim we compute at any momentum and filling the static charge susceptibility of the Hubbard model within the Gutzwiller approximation and we find that electron-electron correlations effectively screen the electron coupling to the lattice. This screening is more effective at large momenta and, as a consequence, the charge-density wave phase due to the usual Peierls instability of the Fermi surface momenta is replaced by a phase-separation instability when the correlations are sizable."
electron,Electron structure of the Falicov-Kimball model with a magnetic field,"The two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is investigated by the dynamical mean-field theory. Within the model the interplay between electron correlations and the fine electron structure due to the magnetic field is essentially emerged. Without electron correlations the magnetic field induces the electron structure to the so-called Hofstadter butterfly. It is found that when electron correlations drives the metal-insulator transition, they simultaneously smear out the fine structure of the Hofstadter butterfly. In a long-range ordered phase, the electron correlation induced gap preserves the fine structure, but it separates the Hofstadter butterfly into two wings."
electron,One-dimensional interacting electrons beyond the Dzyaloshinskii-Larkin   theorem,"We consider one-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons beyond the Dzyaloshinskii-Larkin theorem, i.e., keeping forward scattering interactions among the electrons but adding a non-linear correction to the electron dispersion relation. The latter generates multi-loop corrections to the polarization operator and electron self-energy thereby providing a variety of inelastic processes affecting equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium properties of the 1D system. We first review the computation of equilibrium properties, e.g., the high frequency part of the dynamical structure factor and corrections to the electron-electron scattering rate. On this basis, microscopic equilibration processes are identified and a qualitative estimate of the relaxation rate of thermal carriers is given."
electron,Energy spectrum of pseudospin-electron model in the dynamical mean-field   theory,"The pseudospin-electron model in the case of infinite on-site electron repulsion is investigated. The electron energy spectrum is calculated within the framework of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), and the alloy analogy approximation is developed. The effect of the pseudospin-electron interaction, local asymmetry field, and tunneling-like level splitting on the existence and the number of electron subbands is investigated. The relation of the pseudospin-electron model to the problem of energy spectrum of boson-fermion mixtures in optical lattices is discussed."
electron,Spin dynamics of two-dimensional electrons with Rashba spin-orbit   coupling and electron-electron interactions,"We study the spin dynamics of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling by taking account of electron-electron interactions. The diffusion equations for charge and spin densities are derived by making use of the path-integral approach and the quasiclassical Green's function. Analyzing the effect of the interactions, we show that the spin-relaxation time can be enhanced by the electron-electron interaction in the ballistic regime."
electron,Disordered electron liquid in double quantum well heterostructures:   Renormalization group analysis and dephasing rate,"We report a detailed study of the influence of the electron-electron interaction on physical observables (conductance, etc.) of a disordered electron liquid in double quantum well heterostructure. We find that even in the case of common elastic scattering off electrons in both quantum wells, the asymmetry in the electron-electron interaction across and within quantum wells decouples them at low temperatures. Our results are in quantitative agreement with recent transport experiments on the gated double quantum well Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs/Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As heterostructures."
electron,Why is the ground state electron configuration for Lithium $1s^22s$ ?,"The electronic ground state for Lithium is $1s^22s$, and not $1s^22p$. The traditional argument for why this is so is based on a screening argument that claims that the $2p$ electron is better shielded by the $1s$ electrons, and therefore higher in energy then the configuration that includes the $2s$ electron. We show that this argument is flawed, and in fact the actual reason for the ordering is because the electron-electron interaction energy is higher for the $2p-1s$ repulsion than it is for the $2s-1s$ repulsion."
electron,Understanding the fundamental connection between electronic correlation   and decoherence,"We introduce a theory that exposes the fundamental and previously overlooked connection between the correlation among electrons and the degree of quantum coherence of electronic states in matter. For arbitrary states, the effects only decouple when the electronic dynamics induced by the nuclear bath is pure-dephasing in nature such that $[H^{S},H^{SB}]=0$, where $H^{S}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian and $H^{SB}$ is the electron-nuclear coupling. We quantitatively illustrate this connection via exact simulations of a Hubbard-Holstein molecule using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion that show that increasing the degree of electronic interactions can enhance or suppress the rate of electronic coherence loss."
philosophy,Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship,"In this paper I review the problematic relationship between science and philosophy; in particular, I will address the question of whether science needs philosophy, and I will offer some positive (if incomplete) perspectives that should be helpful in developing a synergetic relationship between the two. I will review three lines of reasoning often employed in arguing that philosophy is useless for science: a) philosophy's death diagnosis ('philosophy is dead') and what follows from it; b) the historic-agnostic argument/challenge ""show me examples where philosophy has been useful for science, for I don't know of any""; c) the division of property argument (or: philosophy and science have different subject matters, therefore philosophy is useless for science).   These arguments will be countered with three contentions to the effect that the natural sciences need philosophy. I will: a) point to the fallacy of anti-philosophicalism (or: 'in order to deny the need for philosophy, one must do philosophy') and examine the role of paradigms and presuppositions (or: why science can't live without philosophy); b) point out why the historical argument fails (in an example from quantum mechanics, alive and kicking); c) briefly sketch some domains of intersection of science and philosophy and how the two can have mutual synergy. I will conclude with some implications of this synergetic relationship between science and philosophy for the liberal arts and sciences."

RPYS allows us to identify peak years in citations in a field, which promises to help scholars identify the key contributions to a field, and revolutionary discoveries in a field. We discovered that philosophy of science, a sub-field in the humanities, differs significantly from other fields examined with this method. Books play a more important role in philosophy of science than in the sciences. Further, Einstein's famous 1905 papers created a citation peak in the philosophy of science literature. But rather than being a contribution to the philosophy of science, their importance lies in the fact that they are revolutionary contributions to physics with important implications for philosophy of science."

Besides their conspicuous early Renaissance scientific instruments and tools, they contain numerous apparently unreported concealments whose detection reveals heresies expressed in the work. The main one is encoded in the motto {\em MELENCOLIA I} itself: Natural Philosophy, not Mathematical Philosophy or Theological Philosophy, is the way to knowledge. Unusual optical illusions and subliminal images, differing between the two versions, declare the relativity and ambiguity of perception, and indicate that the work was a Humanist document intended for a Humanist viewership."

Recently, I proposed measurement theory, which is characterized as the metaphysical and linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. I assert that this theory is one of the most fundamental languages in science, and thus, it is located at the central position in science. This assertion will be examined throughout this preprint, which is written as the draft of my future book (concerning the philosophy of science). Hence, I hope to hear various opinions about this draft."

philosophy,Foundations of Modern Physics in the Scope of Philosophical   Interpretation of the Phenomenon of Temporariness,"The article discusses foundations of the modern philosophy of physics and their transformations via development of the images of time. The author proves six main theses. (1) An analysis of relations between scientific knowledge and the nature of time visualizes the foundations of contemporary philosophy of physics. (2) The Universal Clock, understood as a symbol, discloses in philosophy of physics a prospect to comprehension of the general foundations. (3) The association of the science and human being demonstrates the prospects to constitution of the philosophy of physics based on some features of the human nature, its dependence from time duration. (4) The modernistic meaning of time provides the opportunity to find the general basics of the scientific knowledge. (5) Contemporary philosophy of physics depends on the phenomenological concept of an intuitive environing world by Husserl, which presupposes the subjective character of time as itself. (6) The symbolization of the Universal Clock discloses the essence of the relationship between the philosophical speculations and the studies in natural science."
philosophy,Wolfgang Pauli 1900 to 1930: His Early Physics in Jungian Perspective,"Wolfgang Pauli's philosophy and physics were intertwined. His philosophy was a variety of Platonism, in which Pauli's affiliation with Carl Jung formed an integral part, but Pauli's philosophical explorations in physics appeared before he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli's psycho-philosophical perspective. Thus, the roots of Pauli's physics and philosophy are important in the history of modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his theoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive visualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible physical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of mathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung's mandalas. I have connected Pauli's visualization patterns in physics during the period 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some examples of Pauli's creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By looking at Pauli's early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli's contributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on Werner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm logical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron spinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum physicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of quantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during his early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often contradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon published and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has emerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and empiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with disturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek treatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after 1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy allied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli sought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58."
philosophy,Philosophy and problems of the definition of Extraterrestrial Life,"When we try to search for extraterrestrial life and intelligence, we have to follow some guidelines. The first step is to clarify what is to be meant by ""Life"" and ""intelligence"", i.e. an attempt to define these words. The word ""definition"" refers to two different situations. First, it means an arbitrary convention. On the other hand it also often designates an attempt to clarify the content of a pre-existing word for which we have some spontaneous preconceptions, whatever their grounds, and to catch an (illusory) ""essence"" of what is defined. It is then made use of pre-existing plain language words which carry an a priori pre-scientific content likely to introduce some confusion in the reader's mind. The complexity of the problem will be analyzed and we will show that some philosophical prejudice is unavoidable. There are two types of philosophy: ""Natural Philosophy"", seeking for some essence of things, and ""Critical (or analytical) Philosophy"", devoted to the analysis of the procedures by which we claim to construct a reality. An extension of Critical Philosophy, Epistemo-Analysis (i.e. the Psycho-Analysis of concepts) is presented and applied to the defintion of Life and to Astrobiology."
philosophy,Conceptual Preconditions of Overcoming of Relativistic Intentions in   Modern Philosophy of Science,"The paper defends the thesis that it's possible to maintain some conceptual preconditions of overcoming of relativistic intentions in modern philosophy of science (""there are no any general foundations in philosophy of science""). We found two general foundations in philosophy of science as a minimum. From the first side it's realistic to reveal on the base of special understanding of time the value of time not only in natural thought (especially in theory of gravity) but also in humanitarian knowledge. That's why philosophy of science has independent position in epistemology and ontology corresponding to interpretation of time as a general category of scientific thinking. The nature of time has internally inconsistent (paradoxical) character. Time is phenomenon which existing and not existing at the same time. This phenomenon is identified with imaginary movement and also ideal (formal) process of formation of the nature. The general understanding of time is connected with its ""mathematical"" meaning as calculable formal regulation of language practice and also the universal organization rules of quantitative parameters of intelligence of natural (physical) processes. From the second side we can say that exist an actual branch of philosophy of science. It exists on the basis of disclosure of aprioristic limits of consciousness of its cultural and historical development. There is possible a special interpretation of time. In that context time is the connection of an action of the cultural phenomenon or its ""energy"" with some kind of ""weight"", the historical importance of a separate limit of consciousness through analog of ""distance"" as intensity of cultural and historical space (or ""oppositional nature of interaction of mental intentions"")."
philosophy,Feyerabend and physics,"Feyerabend frequently discussed physics. He also referred to the history of the subject when motivating his philosophy of science. Alas, as some examples show, his understanding of physics remained superficial. In this respect, Feyerabend is like Popper; the difference being his self-criticism later on, and the much more tolerant attitude toward the allowance of methods. Quite generally, partly due to the complexity of the formalism and the new challenges of their findings, which left philosophy proper at a loss, physicists have attempted to developed their own meaning of their subject. For instance, in recent years, the interpretation of quantum mechanics has stimulated a new type of experimental philosophy, which seeks to operationalize emerging philosophical issues; issues which are incomprehensible for most philosophers. In this respect, physics often appears to be a continuation of philosophy by other means. Yet, Feyerabend has also expressed profound insights into the possibilities for the progress of physics, a legacy which remains to be implemented in the times to come: the conquest of abundance, the richness of reality, the many worlds which still await discovery, and the vast openness of the physical universe."
philosophy,Philosophy Enters the Optics Laboratory: Bell's Theorem and its First   Experimental Tests (1965-1982),"This paper deals with the ways that the issue of completing quantum mechanics was brought into laboratories and became a topic in mainstream quantum optics. It focuses on the period between 1965, when Bell published what now we call Bell's theorem, and 1982, when Aspect published the results of his experiments. I argue that what was considered good physics after Aspect's experiments was once considered by many a philosophical matter instead of a scientific one, and that the path from philosophy to physics required a change in the physics community's attitude about the status of the foundations of quantum mechanics."
philosophy,Boltzmann's Concept of Reality,"In this article we describe and analyze the concept of reality developed by the Austrian theoretical physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. It is our thesis that Boltzmann was fully aware that reality could, and actually was, described by different points of view. In spite of this, Boltzmann did not renounce the idea that reality is real. We also discuss his main motivations to be strongly involved with philosophy of science, as well as further developments made by Boltzmann himself of his main philosophical ideas, namely scientific theories as images of Nature and its consequences. We end the paper with a discussion about the modernity of Boltzmann's philosophy of science."
philosophy,Phenomenology of Philosophy of Science: OPERA data,"I observe that, as the physics side of the OPERA-anomaly story is apparently unfolding, there can still be motivation for philosophy of science to analyze the six months of madness physicists spent chasing the dream of a new fundamental-physics revolution. I here mainly report data on studies of the OPERA anomaly that could be relevant for analyses from the perspective of phenomenology of philosophy of science. Most of what I report is an insider's perspective on the debate that evolved from the original announcement by the OPERA collaboration of evidence of superluminal neutrinos. I also sketch out, from a broader perspective, some of the objectives I view as achievable for the phenomenology of philosophy of science."
philosophy,The Linguistic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,"About twenty years ago, we proposed the mathematical formulation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and further, we concluded that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and EPR-paradox are not contradictory. This is true, however we now think that we should have argued about it under a certain firm interpretation of quantum mechanics. Recently we proposed the linguistic quantum interpretation (called quantum and classical measurement theory), which was characterized as a kind of metaphysical and linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation. This turn from physics to language does not only extend quantum theory to classical systems but also yield the quantum mechanical world view (i.e., the philosophy of quantum mechanics, in other words, quantum philosophy). In fact, we can consider that traditional philosophies have progressed toward quantum philosophy. In this paper, we first review the linguistic quantum interpretation, and further, clarify the relation between EPR-paradox and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. That is, the linguistic interpretation says that EPR-paradox is closely related to the fact that syllogism does not generally hold in quantum physics. This fact should be compared to the non-locality of Bell's inequality."
philosophy,Questions for a Materialist Philosophy Implying the Equivalence of   Computers and Human Cognition,"Issues related to a materialist philosophy are explored as concerns the implied equivalence of computers running software and human observers. One issue explored concerns the measurement process in quantum mechanics. Another issue explored concerns the nature of experience as revealed by the existence of dreams. Some difficulties stemming from a materialist philosophy as regards these issues are pointed out. For example, a gedankenexperiment involving what has been called ""negative"" observation is discussed that illustrates the difficulty with a materialist assumption in quantum mechanics. Based on an exploration of these difficulties, specifications are outlined briefly that would provide a means to demonstrate the equivalence of of computers running software and human experience given a materialist assumption."
philosophy,Quantum spacetime: what do we know?,"This is a contribution to a book on quantum gravity and philosophy. I discuss nature and origin of the problem of quantum gravity. I examine the knowledge that may guide us in addressing this problem, and the reliability of such knowledge. In particular, I discuss the subtle modification of the notions of space and time engendered by general relativity, and how these might merge into quantum theory. I also present some reflections on methodological questions, and on some general issues in philosophy of science which are are raised by, or a relevant for, the research on quantum gravity."
philosophy,Bipartite Mixed States of Infinite-Dimensional Systems are Generically   Nonseparable,"Given a bipartite quantum system represented by a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces, we give an elementary argument showing that if either component space is infinite-dimensional, then the set of nonseparable density operators is trace-norm dense in the set of all density operators (and the separable density operators nowhere dense). This result complements recent detailed investigations of separability, which show that when both component Hilbert spaces are finite-dimensional, there is a separable neighborhood (perhaps very small for large dimensions) of the maximally mixed state."
philosophy,Complexity,"The term complexity derives etymologically from the Latin plexus, which means interwoven. Intuitively, this implies that something complex is composed by elements that are difficult to separate. This difficulty arises from the relevant interactions that take place between components. This lack of separability is at odds with the classical scientific method - which has been used since the times of Galileo, Newton, Descartes, and Laplace - and has also influenced philosophy and engineering. In recent decades, the scientific study of complexity and complex systems has proposed a paradigm shift in science and philosophy, proposing novel methods that take into account relevant interactions."
philosophy,Matheme and mathematics. On the main concepts of the philosophy of Alain   Badiou,"In this paper, I present a critical discussion of mathematical arguments employed in the philosophy of event of Alain Badiou. On the basis of ""Being and Event"" as well as his other writings, I analyze the main notions of his philosophy such as the indiscernible, the undecidable, and the unnameable. The focus of my analysis is both on their mathematical consistency, and their philosophical consequences. I argue that the mathematical approach developed by Badiou is seriously defective, and, as a result, that it cannot serve as an ontological basis for the concept of event as presented in ""Being and Event""."
philosophy,On Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics,"Mathematics cannot anymore be assimilated to a linguistic game, where formal proofs are strongly differentiated with conjectural thinking, without building any category of knowledge to understand the passage (Wittgenstein's gist). Nowadays, philosophy has to face with the growing, exponential ramified tree of speculative mathematical thinking. Our main (problematical) theses are: 1. In mathematics, there is no empirical automatism, and no separate, physical-like motricity. 2: The irreversible-synthetical must force to complexify the exegetical game of philosophy; numerical experiments in algebra and in number theory are a kind of letting blow up all possible problems; 4. The nature of mathematical questioning still remains in question."
philosophy,Possibilities of technologization of philosophical knowledge,"Article purpose is the analysis of a question of possibility of technologization of philosophical knowledge. We understand the organization of cognitive activity which is guided by the set of methods guaranteed bringing to successful (i.e. to precisely corresponding set parameters) to applied results as technologization. Transformation of sense of philosophy allows revealing possibilities of its technologization. The leading role in this process is played by philosophy of science which creates conditions for such transformation. At the same time there is justified an appeal to branch combination theory of the directions of scientific knowledge and partial refusal of understanding of philosophy as synthetic knowledge in which the main task is permission, instead of generation of paradoxes."
philosophy,"Ockham's Razor, Probability and Quantum Physics as Logic","This is a philosophy-intense physics article, or, if you wish, a physics-intense philosophy article. Also, being a mathematician, I tend to view the physics, in particular the essence of quantum physics, in emphasizing the mathematical structure that serves as its language. However, I do express views on typically philosophical/epistemological matters. Since these points of view do not seem to me too widely expressed in the literature, while I find them quite compelling, I think this note has some interest."
philosophy,Blurring Out Cosmic Puzzles,"The Doomsday argument and anthropic reasoning are two puzzling examples of probabilistic confirmation. In both cases, a lack of knowledge apparently yields surprising conclusions. Since they are formulated within a Bayesian framework, they constitute a challenge to Bayesianism. Several attempts, some successful, have been made to avoid these conclusions, but some versions of these arguments cannot be dissolved within the framework of orthodox Bayesianism. I show that adopting an imprecise framework of probabilistic reasoning allows for a more adequate representation of ignorance in Bayesian reasoning and explains away these puzzles."
philosophy,Economics cannot isolate itself from political theory: a mathematical   demonstration,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a confession of sorts from an economist to political science and philosophy. A confession of the weaknesses of the political position of the economist. It is intended as a guide for political scientists and philosophers to the ostensible policy criteria of economics, and an illustration of an argument that demonstrates logico-mathematically, therefore incontrovertibly, that any policy statement by an economist contains, or is, a political statement. It develops an inescapable compulsion that the absolute primacy and priority of political theory and philosophy in the development of policy criteria must be recognised. Economic policy cannot be divorced from politics as a matter of mathematical fact, and rather, as Amartya Sen has done, it ought embrace political theory and philosophy."
philosophy,Relationalism vs. Bayesianism,"We compare and contrast the basic principles of two philosophies: Bayesianism and relationalism. These two philosophies are both based upon criteria of rationality. The analogy invoked in such a comparison seems rather apt when discussing tentative proofs of quantum nonlocality. We argue that Bayesianism is almost to quantum theory, what general covariance is to general relativity. This is because the Bayesian interpretation of quantum theory can be given a relational flavour."
philosophy,String Theory: a theory in search of an experiment,It is argued that string theory may pose new conceptual issues for the history and philosophy of science.
philosophy,Quantum Mechanics as a Principle Theory,"I show how quantum mechanics, like the theory of relativity, can be understood as a 'principle theory' in Einstein's sense, and I use this notion to explore the approach to the problem of interpretation developed in my book Interpreting the Quantum World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999)."
philosophy,Time Cycles in Indian Cosmology,"In this article we review some key time cycles in ancient Indian astronomy, especially those that have emerged from researches in the past couple of decades expressing knowledge of the changing frame of earth's axis. The article also briefly reviews the philosophy related to the interconnection between the inner and the outer cosmos that was used in the analytical narrative related to this astronomy."
philosophy,Do the uncertainty relations really have crucial significances for   physics ?,It is proved the falsity of idea that the Uncertainty Relations (UR) have crucial significances for physics. Additionally one argues for the necesity of an UR-disconnected quantum philosophy.
philosophy,Diverse Consequences of Algorithmic Probability,"We reminisce and discuss applications of algorithmic probability to a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence, philosophy and technological society. We propose that Solomonoff has effectively axiomatized the field of artificial intelligence, therefore establishing it as a rigorous scientific discipline. We also relate to our own work in incremental machine learning and philosophy of complexity."
philosophy,In search of lost spacetime: philosophical issues arising in quantum   gravity,This essay presents an accessible introduction to the basic motivations to seek a quantum theory of gravity. It focuses on one approach- loop quantum gravity - as an example of the rich philosophical issues that arise when we try to combine spacetime and quantum physics.
philosophy,Cosmic Conundrums,"What do we do when cosmology raises questions it cannot answer? These include the existence of a multiverse and the universality of the laws of physics. We cannot settle any of these issues by experiment, and this is where philosophers enter the debate. Drawing the line between philosophy and physics has never been easy. Perhaps it is time to stop trying. The interface is ripe for exploration."
philosophy,"|{Math, Philosophy, Programming, Writing}| = 1","Philosophical thinking has a side effect: by aiming to find the essence of a diverse set of phenomena, it often makes it difficult to see the differences between them. This can be the case with Mathematics, Programming, Writing and Philosophy itself. Their unified essence is having a shared understanding of the world helped by off-loading our cognitive efforts to suitable languages."
philosophy,Issues in the Philosophy of Cosmology,"After a survey of the present state of cosmological theory and observations, this article discusses a series of major themes underlying the relation of philosophy to cosmology. These are: A: The uniqueness of the universe; B: The large scale of the universe in space and time; C: The unbound energies in the early universe; D: Explaining the universe -- the question of origins; E: The universe as the background for existence; F: The explicit philosophical basis; G: The Anthropic question: fine tuning for life; H: The possible existence of multiverses; I: The natures of existence. Each of these themes is explored and related to a series of Theses that set out the major issues confronting cosmology in relation to philosophy."

philosophy,Beyond the Physics of Logic: Aspects of Transcendental Materialism or   URAM in a Modern View,"It has been shown at other occasions that recent results of modern physics can be used to shed some more light onto the foundations of the world, provided the actual task of philosophy is being re-interpreted in terms of a theory which is following up the results of science rather than laying the grounds for the latter, contrary to what the original intention of Aristotelian ""prima philo- sophia"" would imply. As it turns out, the interpretation of the main results of present research dealing with aspects of quantum information theory and quantum gravity, respectively, as well as with self-organized criticality, suffices to re-construct a large class of phenomena not only within the field of physics proper, but also within chemistry, biology, and even the social sciences. We show that questions of ultimate reality and meaning can only be answered within a framework of speculative philosophy which is rooted though in what sceptic philosophy is able to derive from scientific results."

philosophy,"Einstein et la mecanique quantique - Quelques reperes, quelques   surprises","Even if Einstein brought major contributions as a founder of quantum mechanics, he remained deeply unsatisfied with the bases of this structure he knew to be so efficient for physics. His critics are often known through his numerous controversies wih N. Bohr for a few decades. It has long been suggested that his critics were obsolete and came from an aging man and that it was more a question of philosophy anyway. After J. Bell's contribution however it was claimed that the debate could be closed by an experimental proof, a strange experimental intrusion in philosophy or a strange philosophy. Finally, the experiment being performed, in particular in Orsay with the repeatedly successful experiments of A. Aspect, it was claimed that N. Bohr won. Would the debate be closed? Today and fifty years after his death, it seems that Einstein's critics to quantum mechanics are being regarded differently. Why is it so? Is it due to physics coming back to the debate? It will be attempted to accurately report Einstein's writings on the matter and to find elements of answer to the raised questions."

philosophy,"Einstein, Kant, and Taoism","It is said that Einstein's conceptual base for the theory of relativity was the philosophy formulated by Immanuel Kant. Then, is it possible to see how Kant played a role in Einstein's thinking without reading Kant's books? This question arises because it is not possible for physicists to read Kant's writings. Yes, it is possible if we use the method of physics. It is known also that Kant's mode of thinking was profoundly affected by the geography of Koenigsberg where he spent eighty years of entire life. We examine what aspect of this geography led Kant to create his philosophy upon which Einstein's concept of relativity was based. It is pointed out that the Eastern philosophy of Taoism is a product of the geographical environment similar to that of Kant's Koenigsberg, and therefore that Kantianism is strikingly similar to Taoism."

Contrary to philosophy of science, which is a subject for philosophers, philosophy in science calls on the services of physicists. When, in its spirit, quantum theory and Bell's theorem are used as touchstones, the two main traditional philosophical approaches, realism and idealism, are found wanting. A more suitable conception seems to be an intermediate one, in which the mere postulated existence of a holistic and hardly knowable Mind-Independent Reality is found to have an explaining power. Some corrections to comments by Schins of a previous work on the same subject are incorporated."
philosophy,Losing Your Marbles in Wavefunction Collapse Theories,"Peter Lewis ([1997]) has recently argued that the wavefunction collapse theory of GRW (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber [1986]) can only solve the problem of wavefunction tails at the expense of predicting that arithmetic does not apply to ordinary macroscopic objects. More specifically, Lewis argues that the GRW theory must violate the enumeration principle: that `if marble 1 is in the box and marble 2 is in the box and so on through marble $n$, then all $n$ marbles are in the box' ([1997], p. 321). Ghirardi and Bassi ([1999]) have replied that it is meaningless to say that the enumeration principle is violated because the wavefunction Lewis uses to exhibit the violation cannot persist, according to the GRW theory, for more than a split second ([1999], p. 709). On the contrary, we argue that Lewis's argument survives Ghirardi and Bassi's criticism unscathed. We then go on to show that, while the enumeration principle can fail in the GRW theory, the theory itself guarantees that the principle can never be empirically falsified, leaving the applicability of arithmetical reasoning to both micro- and macroscopic objects intact."
philosophy,Counting Marbles with 'Accessible' Mass Density: A Reply to Bassi and   Ghirardi,"In a previous article (cf. quant-ph/9905065) we argued that, while Lewis is correct that the enumeration principle fails in dynamical wavepacket reduction theories, one need not following Lewis in rejecting these theories. Because the dynamical reduction process itself prevents the failure of enumeration from ever becoming manifest, and because one can treat the semantics for dynamical reduction theories as not adding anything of ontological import to them, it is reasonable to accept these theories notwithstanding Lewis's counting anomaly. In their response to our paper (cf. quant-ph/9907050), Bassi and Ghirardi reject our criticisms of their own response to Lewis, as well as our argument against Lewis that dynamical reduction precludes failures of enumeration from ever becoming manifest. Our intention here is to demonstrate that Bassi and Ghirardi's responses to us do not succeed."

I will very briefly survey one of Turing's other contributions to the philosophy of information and computation, including similarities to Shannon's own methodological approach to information through communication, showing how crucial they are and have been as methodological strategies to understanding key aspects of these concepts. While Floridi's concept of Levels of Abstraction is related to the novel methodology of Turing's imitation game for tackling the question of machine intelligence, Turing's other main contribution to the philosophy of information runs contrary to it. Indeed, the seminal concept of computation universality strongly suggests the deletion of fundamental differences among seemingly different levels of description. How might we reconcile these apparently contradictory contributions? I will argue that Turing's contribution should prompt us to plot some directions for a philosophy of information and computation, one that closely parallels the most important developments in computer science, one that understands the profound implications of the works of Turing, Shannon and others."

From the study of evolution of numerous earlier processors, we derive the basis for the architecture of MPUs. These specialized processors perform unique medical functions encoded as medical operational codes (mopcs). From a pragmatic perspective, MPUs function very close to CPUs. Both processors have unique operation codes that command the hardware to perform a distinct chain of subprocesses upon operands and generate a specific result unique to the opcode and the operand(s). In medical environments, MPU decodes the mopcs and executes a series of medical sub-processes and sends out secondary commands to the medical machine. Whereas operands in a typical computer system are numerical and logical entities, the operands in medical machine are objects such as such as patients, blood samples, tissues, operating rooms, medical staff, medical bills, patient payments, etc. We follow the functional overlap between the two processes and evolve the design of medical computer systems and networks."

Multi-modal medical image fusion algorithms and devices have shown notable achievements in improving clinical accuracy of decisions based on medical images. This review article provides a factual listing of methods and summarizes the broad scientific challenges faced in the field of medical image fusion. We characterize the medical image fusion research based on (1) the widely used image fusion methods, (2) imaging modalities, and (3) imaging of organs that are under study. This review concludes that even though there exists several open ended technological and scientific challenges, the fusion of medical images has proved to be useful for advancing the clinical reliability of using medical imaging for medical diagnostics and analysis, and is a scientific discipline that has the potential to significantly grow in the coming years."

To tackle this issue, we have proposed using a fuzzy-based modeling and description technique for capturing uncertainties in treatment plans. We have further contributed a formal framework which allows for goal-oriented modeling and analysis of medical treatments."

Four medical time series datasets are used to show the accuracy improvement Bayesian LSTMs provide over standard LSTMs. Moreover, we show cherry-picked examples of confident and uncertain classifications of the medical time series. With simple modifications of the common practice for deep learning, significant improvements can be made for the medical practitioner and patient."

medical,Ranking medical jargon in electronic health record notes by adapted   distant supervision,"Objective: Allowing patients to access their own electronic health record (EHR) notes through online patient portals has the potential to improve patient-centered care. However, medical jargon, which abounds in EHR notes, has been shown to be a barrier for patient EHR comprehension. Existing knowledge bases that link medical jargon to lay terms or definitions play an important role in alleviating this problem but have low coverage of medical jargon in EHRs. We developed a data-driven approach that mines EHRs to identify and rank medical jargon based on its importance to patients, to support the building of EHR-centric lay language resources.   Methods: We developed an innovative adapted distant supervision (ADS) model based on support vector machines to rank medical jargon from EHRs. For distant supervision, we utilized the open-access, collaborative consumer health vocabulary, a large, publicly available resource that links lay terms to medical jargon. We explored both knowledge-based features from the Unified Medical Language System and distributed word representations learned from unlabeled large corpora. We evaluated the ADS model using physician-identified important medical terms.   Results: Our ADS model significantly surpassed two state-of-the-art automatic term recognition methods, TF*IDF and C-Value, yielding 0.810 ROC-AUC versus 0.710 and 0.667, respectively. Our model identified 10K important medical jargon terms after ranking over 100K candidate terms mined from over 7,500 EHR narratives.   Conclusion: Our work is an important step towards enriching lexical resources that link medical jargon to lay terms/definitions to support patient EHR comprehension. The identified medical jargon terms and their rankings are available upon request."
medical,Bringing Semantic Structures to User Intent Detection in Online Medical   Queries,"The Internet has revolutionized healthcare by offering medical information ubiquitously to patients via web search. The healthcare status, complex medical information needs of patients are expressed diversely and implicitly in their medical text queries. Aiming to better capture a focused picture of user's medical-related information search and shed insights on their healthcare information access strategies, it is challenging yet rewarding to detect structured user intentions from their diversely expressed medical text queries. We introduce a graph-based formulation to explore structured concept transitions for effective user intent detection in medical queries, where each node represents a medical concept mention and each directed edge indicates a medical concept transition. A deep model based on multi-task learning is introduced to extract structured semantic transitions from user queries, where the model extracts word-level medical concept mentions as well as sentence-level concept transitions collectively. A customized graph-based mutual transfer loss function is designed to impose explicit constraints and further exploit the contribution of mentioning a medical concept word to the implication of a semantic transition. We observe an 8% relative improvement in AUC and 23% relative reduction in coverage error by comparing the proposed model with the best baseline model for the concept transition inference task on real-world medical text queries."

This enables users to rapidly gain contextual understanding of their medical topics of interest, and we believe this constitutes a significant user experience improvement over contemporary search engines operating in the biomedical literature domain."
medical,Harmonization of conflicting medical opinions using argumentation   protocols and textual entailment - a case study on Parkinson disease,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than 1.2 million people in Europe. Medications are available for the management of its symptoms, but the exact cause of the disease is unknown and there is currently no cure on the market. To better understand the relations between new findings and current medical knowledge, we need tools able to analyse published medical papers based on natural language processing and tools capable to identify various relationships of new findings with the current medical knowledge. Our work aims to fill the above technological gap.   To identify conflicting information in medical documents, we enact textual entailment technology. To encapsulate existing medical knowledge, we rely on ontologies. To connect the formal axioms in ontologies with natural text in medical articles, we exploit ontology verbalisation techniques. To assess the level of disagreement between human agents with respect to a medical issue, we rely on fuzzy aggregation. To harmonize this disagreement, we design mediation protocols within a multi-agent framework."
medical,Synthetic Medical Images from Dual Generative Adversarial Networks,"Currently there is strong interest in data-driven approaches to medical image classification. However, medical imaging data is scarce, expensive, and fraught with legal concerns regarding patient privacy. Typical consent forms only allow for patient data to be used in medical journals or education, meaning the majority of medical data is inaccessible for general public research. We propose a novel, two-stage pipeline for generating synthetic medical images from a pair of generative adversarial networks, tested in practice on retinal fundi images. We develop a hierarchical generation process to divide the complex image generation task into two parts: geometry and photorealism. We hope researchers will use our pipeline to bring private medical data into the public domain, sparking growth in imaging tasks that have previously relied on the hand-tuning of models. We have begun this initiative through the development of SynthMed, an online repository for synthetic medical images."
medical,Real-Time Impulse Noise Removal from MR Images for Radiosurgery   Applications,"In the recent years image processing techniques are used as a tool to improve detection and diagnostic capabilities in the medical applications. Medical applications have been so much affected by these techniques which some of them are embedded in medical instruments such as MRI, CT and other medical devices. Among these techniques, medical image enhancement algorithms play an essential role in removal of the noise which can be produced by medical instruments and during image transfer. It has been proved that impulse noise is a major type of noise, which is produced during medical operations, such as MRI, CT, and angiography, by their image capturing devices. An embeddable hardware module which is able to denoise medical images before and during surgical operations could be very helpful. In this paper an accurate algorithm is proposed for real-time removal of impulse noise in medical images. All image blocks are divided into three categories of edge, smooth, and disordered areas. A different reconstruction method is applied to each category of blocks for the purpose of noise removal. The proposed method is tested on MR images. Simulation results show acceptable denoising accuracy for various levels of noise. Also an FPAG implementation of our denoising algorithm shows acceptable hardware resource utilization. Hence, the algorithm is suitable for embedding in medical hardware instruments such as radiosurgery devices."

In this paper, we aim to capture these relationships by constructing a large and high-quality heterogenous graph linking patients, diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs. Specifically, we propose a novel framework to extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD graph presented in this paper is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint, and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as effective treatment recommendations."

medical,Using a bag of Words for Automatic Medical Image Annotation with a   Latent Semantic,"We present in this paper a new approach for the automatic annotation of medical images, using the approach of ""bag-of-words"" to represent the visual content of the medical image combined with text descriptors based approach tf.idf and reduced by latent semantic to extract the co-occurrence between terms and visual terms. A medical report is composed of a text describing a medical image. First, we are interested to index the text and extract all relevant terms using a thesaurus containing MeSH medical concepts. In a second phase, the medical image is indexed while recovering areas of interest which are invariant to change in scale, light and tilt. To annotate a new medical image, we use the approach of ""bagof-words"" to recover the feature vector. Indeed, we use the vector space model to retrieve similar medical image from the database training. The calculation of the relevance value of an image to the query image is based on the cosine function. We conclude with an experiment carried out on five types of radiological imaging to evaluate the performance of our system of medical annotation. The results showed that our approach works better with more images from the radiology of the skull."

The required system implements the suitable informatics and electronics solutions efficiently for the Tele-medicine care. We proposed an approach to manage different multimedia medical databases in the telemedicine system. In order to be efficiently and effectively manage, search, and display database information, we define an information package for both of doctor and patient as a concise data set of their medical information from each visit. The methodology for accessing various types of medical records will be provided, also we will design two web-based interfaces, high-quality data and display for many medical service purposes."

This study was undertaken at College of Medicine and Medical Sciences (CMMS), Taif University during the academic year 2008 to identify English for Medical Purposes (EMP) needs of the medical undergraduates. Multiple methods of data collection such as exploratory interviews, observations and a questionnaire were used to find out their linguistic needs and the data were triangulated to validate the findings. The findings offered significant insights in selecting suitable course contents to teach English to freshmen medical undergraduates of CMMS. It has been reported that 1) the students lacked the required level of English language proficiency, 2) they needed reading and speaking skills more than others and 3) the data analysis also helped identify the most important language tasks in the context of CMMS. Both populations; the faculty members and the medical undergraduates, recommended that English contact hours should be increased and that EMP should be emphasized more instead of EAP to prepare the learners for their medical studies"
medical,Block Based Medical Image Watermarking Technique for Tamper Detection   and Recovery,"In this paper, we propose a novel fragile block based medical image watermarking technique for embedding data of patient into medical image, verifying the integrity of ROI (Region of Interest), detecting the tampered blocks inside ROI and recovering original ROI with less size authentication and recovery data and with simple mathematical calculations. In the proposed method, the medical image is divided into three regions called ROI, RONI (Region of Non Interest) and border pixels. Later, authentication data of ROI and Electronic Patient Record (EPR) are compressed using Run Length Encoding (RLE) technique and then embedded into ROI. Recovery information of ROI is embedded inside RONI and information of ROI is embedded inside border pixels. Results of experiments conducted on several medical images reveal that proposed method produces high quality watermarked medical images, identifies tampered areas inside ROI of watermarked medical images and recovers the original ROI."
medical,Adaptive Reversible Watermarking Based on Linear Prediction for Medical   Videos,"Reversible video watermarking can guarantee that the original watermark and the original frame can be recovered from the watermarked frame without any distortion. Although reversible video watermarking has successfully been applied in multimedia, but its application has not been extensively explored in medical videos. Reversible watermarking in medical videos is still a challenging problem. The existing reversible video watermarking algorithms, which are based on error prediction expansion, use motion vectors for prediction. In this study, we propose an adaptive reversible watermarking method for medical videos. We suggest to use temporal correlations for improving the prediction accuracy. Hence, two temporal neighbor pixels in upcoming frames are used alongside the four spatial rhombus neighboring pixels to minimize the prediction error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this method is applied for medical videos. The method helps to protect patients' personal and medical information by watermarking, i.e. increase the security of Health Information Systems (HIS). Experimental results demonstrate a high quality watermarking based on PSNR metric and a large capacity for data hiding on medical videos."

Background:   During the last decade, documents summarization got increasing attention by the AI research community. More recently it also attracted the interest of the medical research community as well, due to the enormous growth of information that is available to the physicians and researchers in medicine, through the large and growing number of published journals, conference proceedings, medical sites and portals on the World Wide Web, electronic medical records, etc.   Methodology:   This survey gives first a general background on documents summarization, presenting the factors that summarization depends upon, discussing evaluation issues and describing briefly the various types of summarization techniques. It then examines the characteristics of the medical domain through the different types of medical documents.

medical,Prospective Study for Semantic Inter-Media Fusion in Content-Based   Medical Image Retrieval,"One important challenge in modern Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) approaches is represented by the semantic gap, related to the complexity of the medical knowledge. Among the methods that are able to close this gap in CBMIR, the use of medical thesauri/ontologies has interesting perspectives due to the possibility of accessing on-line updated relevant webservices and to extract real-time medical semantic structured information. The CBMIR approach proposed in this paper uses the Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS) Metathesaurus to perform a semantic indexing and fusion of medical media. This fusion operates before the query processing (retrieval) and works at an UMLS-compliant conceptual indexing level. Our purpose is to study various techniques related to semantic data alignment, preprocessing, fusion, clustering and retrieval, by evaluating the various techniques and highlighting future research directions. The alignment and the preprocessing are based on partial text/image retrieval feedback and on the data structure. We analyze various probabilistic, fuzzy and evidence-based approaches for the fusion process and different similarity functions for the retrieval process. All the proposed methods are evaluated on the Cross Language Evaluation Forum's (CLEF) medical image retrieval benchmark, by focusing also on a more homogeneous component medical image database: the Pathology Education Instructional Resource (PEIR)."
medical,Medical Concept Representation Learning from Electronic Health Records   and its Application on Heart Failure Prediction,"Objective: To transform heterogeneous clinical data from electronic health records into clinically meaningful constructed features using data driven method that rely, in part, on temporal relations among data. Materials and Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing approaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT codes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of the existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept representation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence patterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a simple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept vectors. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we study similar medical concepts across diagnosis, medication and procedure. In quantitative evaluation, our proposed representation significantly improves the predictive modeling performance for onset of heart failure (HF), where classification methods (e.g. logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors) achieve up to 23% improvement in area under the ROC curve (AUC) using this proposed representation. Conclusion: We proposed an effective method for patient and medical concept representation learning. The resulting representation can map relevant concepts together and also improves predictive modeling performance."
medical,Predicting Discharge Medications at Admission Time Based on Deep   Learning,"Predicting discharge medications right after a patient being admitted is an important clinical decision, which provides physicians with guidance on what type of medication regimen to plan for and what possible changes on initial medication may occur during an inpatient stay. It also facilitates medication reconciliation process with easy detection of medication discrepancy at discharge time to improve patient safety. However, since the information available upon admission is limited and patients' condition may evolve during an inpatient stay, these predictions could be a difficult decision for physicians to make. In this work, we investigate how to leverage deep learning technologies to assist physicians in predicting discharge medications based on information documented in the admission note. We build a convolutional neural network which takes an admission note as input and predicts the medications placed on the patient at discharge time. Our method is able to distill semantic patterns from unstructured and noisy texts, and is capable of capturing the pharmacological correlations among medications. We evaluate our method on 25K patient visits and compare with 4 strong baselines. Our methods demonstrate a 20% increase in macro-averaged F1 score than the best baseline."

User has to choose then one of the similar images and annotations related to the selected one are assigned to the new one."

We also describe a NLP system capable of automated finding contradictory medical guidelines; the system uses a combination of text analysis and information retrieval modules. We also report positive evaluation results on a small corpus of contradictory medical recommendations."

Possible applications might be found in medical radiology.
medical,Distributed Object Medical Imaging Model,"Digital medical informatics and images are commonly used in hospitals today,. Because of the interrelatedness of the radiology department and other departments, especially the intensive care unit and emergency department, the transmission and sharing of medical images has become a critical issue. Our research group has developed a Java-based Distributed Object Medical Imaging Model(DOMIM) to facilitate the rapid development and deployment of medical imaging applications in a distributed environment that can be shared and used by related departments and mobile physiciansDOMIM is a unique suite of multimedia telemedicine applications developed for the use by medical related organizations. The applications support realtime patients' data, image files, audio and video diagnosis annotation exchanges. The DOMIM enables joint collaboration between radiologists and physicians while they are at distant geographical locations. The DOMIM environment consists of heterogeneous, autonomous, and legacy resources. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), and Java language provide the capability to combine the DOMIM resources into an integrated, interoperable, and scalable system.

It encompasses a new paradigm for the delivery of health services that requires process reengineering, cultural changes, as well as organizational changes"
medical,A Model of OpenEHR Based Electronic Medical Record In Indonesia,"For the realization of the vision and mission of Healthy Indonesia 2015, we need a health service with a broad and comprehensive scope.To provide health services, it can be realized by creating an integrated information system applications such as creating an electronic medical record that has the ability to process and store patient medical data. The specifications used medical record is an open specification contained in OpenEHR that includes information and service model for electronic medical records, demographics, and the archetype which allows software developers taking the logical structure as a universal functional interface, so it can facilitate the process of information by the recipient. It is because of using the interface with appropriate-purposed data presentation and data on computer screen of the same users. The purpose of this paper is to create an electronic website for the medical record by using OpenEHR specifications for easy accessing, processing and storing the medical records by the actors that play a role in the data processing of medical records. With this application it is expected to be useful for data processing and health information gathering, thus to improve the quality of services that will impact the improved performance of the hospital management. The improved performance of the hospital management will become a supporter of the vision and mission Healthy Indonesia 2015."
medical,Empirical estimates suggest most published medical research is true,"The accuracy of published medical research is critical both for scientists, physicians and patients who rely on these results. But the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false positives in the medical literature using reported P-values as the data. We then collect P-values from the abstracts of all 77,430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. We estimate that the overall rate of false positives among reported results is 14% (s.d. 1%), contrary to previous claims. We also find there is not a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false positive results over time (0.5% more FP per year, P = 0.18) or with respect to journal submissions (0.1% more FP per 100 submissions, P = 0.48). Statistical analysis must allow for false positives in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress."
medical,Utilizing RxNorm to Support Practical Computing Applications: Capturing   Medication History in Live Electronic Health Records,"RxNorm was utilized as the basis for direct-capture of medication history data in a live EHR system deployed in a large, multi-state outpatient behavioral healthcare provider in the United States serving over 75,000 distinct patients each year across 130 clinical locations. This tool incorporated auto-complete search functionality for medications and proper dosage identification assistance. The overarching goal was to understand if and how standardized terminologies like RxNorm can be used to support practical computing applications in live EHR systems. We describe the stages of implementation, approaches used to adapt RxNorm's data structure for the intended EHR application, and the challenges faced. We evaluate the implementation using a four-factor framework addressing flexibility, speed, data integrity, and medication coverage. RxNorm proved to be functional for the intended application, given appropriate adaptations to address high-speed input/output (I/O) requirements of a live EHR and the flexibility required for data entry in multiple potential clinical scenarios. Future research around search optimization for medication entry, user profiling, and linking RxNorm to drug classification schemes holds great potential for improving the user experience and utility of medication data in EHRs."
medical,Inferring Conceptual Relationships When Ranking Patients,"Searching patients based on the relevance of their medical records is challenging because of the inherent implicit knowledge within the patients' medical records and queries. Such knowledge is known to the medical practitioners but may be hidden from a search system. For example, when searching for the patients with a heart disease, medical practitioners commonly know that patients who are taking the amiodarone medicine are relevant, since this drug is used to combat heart disease. In this article, we argue that leveraging such implicit knowledge improves the retrieval effectiveness, since it provides new evidence to infer the relevance of patients' medical records towards a query. Specifically, built upon existing conceptual representation for both medical records and queries, we proposed a novel expansion of queries that infers additional conceptual relationships from domain-specific resources as well as by extracting informative concepts from the top-ranked patients' medical records. We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our proposed approach in the context of the TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records track. Our results show the effectiveness of our approach to model the implicit knowledge in patient search, whereby the retrieval performance is significantly improved over both an effective conceptual representation baseline and an existing semantic query expansion baseline. In addition, we provide an analysis of the types of queries that the proposed approach is likely to be effective."

medical,EMR-based medical knowledge representation and inference via Markov   random fields and distributed representation learning,"Objective: Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain an amount of medical knowledge which can be used for clinical decision support (CDS). Our objective is a general system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in EMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial diagnosis, and treatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient. Methods: We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and constructed an EMR-based medical knowledge network (EMKN), in which nodes are entities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record. Three bipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each task. One part of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and the other was the condition to be inferred (e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was regarded as a Markov random field to support the inference. Three lazy energy functions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two knowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a distributed representation of medical entities. Three measures were utilized for performance evaluation. Results: On the initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of the test records identified at least one correct disease from top 10 candidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%, respectively. These results altogether indicate that the proposed system outperformed the baseline methods. The distributed representation of medical entities does reflect similarity relationships in regards to knowledge level. Conclusion: Combining EMKN and MRF is an effective approach for general medical knowledge representation and inference. Different tasks, however, require designing their energy functions individually."
medical,The Enemy Within: The Emerging Threats to Healthcare from Malicious   Mobile Devices,"With the proliferation of wireless networks, mobile devices and medical devices are increasingly being equipped with wireless interfaces, such as Bluetooth and WiFi to allow easy access to and control of the medical devices. Unfortunately, the very presence and usage of such interfaces also expose the medical devices to novel attacks from malicious parties. The emerging threat from malicious mobile devices is significant and severe, since attackers can steal confidential data from a patient's medical device. Also, attackers can compromise the medical device and either feed doctors bad data from it or issue potentially fatal commands to the device, which may even result in the death of the patient. As the mobile devices are often at close proximity to the patient (either in the hospital or home settings), attacks from such devices are hard to prevent. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of this new threat from mobile devices on medical devices and healthcare infrastructure. We also perform a thorough security analysis of a major hospital and uncover potential vulnerabilities. Finally, we propose a set of potential solutions and defenses against such attacks."
medical,Fast multi-scale edge-detection in medical ultrasound signals,"In this article we suggest a fast multi-scale edge-detection scheme for medical ultrasound signals. The edge-detector is based on well-known properties of the continuous wavelet trans- form. To achieve both good localization of edges and detect only significant edges, we study the maxima-lines of the wavelet transform. One can obtain the maxima-lines between two scales by computing the wavelet transform at several intermediate scales. To reduce computational effort and time we suggest a time-scale filtering procedure which uses only few scales to connect modulus-maxima across time-scale plane. The design of this procedure is based on a study of maxima-lines corresponding to edges typical for medical ultrasound signals. This study allows us to construct an algorithm for medical ultrasound signals which meets the demand for speed, but not on expense of reliability. The edge-detection algorithm has been applied to a large class of medical ultrasound sig- nals including tumour-, liver- and artery-images. Our results show that the proposed algorithm effectively detects major features in such signals, including edges with low contrast."
medical,Development of an Android Application for an Electronic Medical Record   System in an Outpatient Environment for Healthcare in Fiji,The outpatients department in a developing country is typically understaffed and inadequately equipped to handle a large numbers of patients filing through on an average day. The use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems can resolve some of the longstanding medical inefficiencies common in developing countries. This paper presents the design and implementation of a proposed outpatient management system that enables efficient management of a patient's medical details. We present a system to create appointments with medical practitioners by integrating a proposed Android-based mobile application with a selected open source EMR system. The application allows both the patient and the medical practitioners to manage appointments and make use of the electronic messaging facility to send reminders when the appointed time is approaching in real-time. A mobile application prototype is developed and the road map for implementation is also discussed.
medical,A Fresnelet-Based Encryption of Medical Images using Arnold Transform,"Medical images are commonly stored in digital media and transmitted via Internet for certain uses. If a medical information image alters, this can lead to a wrong diagnosis which may create a serious health problem. Moreover, medical images in digital form can easily be modified by wiping off or adding small pieces of information intentionally for certain illegal purposes. Hence, the reliability of medical images is an important criterion in a hospital information system. In this paper, Fresnelet transform is employed along with appropriate handling of the Arnold transform and the discrete cosine transform to provide secure distribution of medical images. This method presents a new data hiding system in which steganography and cryptography are used to prevent unauthorized data access. The experimental results exhibit high imperceptibility for embedded images and significant encryption of information images."
medical,An Integrated Method of Data Hiding and Compression of Medical Images,"A new technique for embedding data into an image coupled with compression has been proposed in this paper. A fast and efficient coding algorithms are needed for effective storage and transmission, due to the popularity of telemedicine and the use of digital medical images. Medical images are produced and transferred between hospitals for review by physicians who are geographically apart. Such image data need to be stored for future reference of patients as well. This necessitates compact storage of medical images before being transmitted over Internet. Moreover, as the patient information is also embedded within the medical images, it is very important to maintain the confidentiality of patient data. Hence, this article aims at hiding patient information as well, within the medical image followed by joint compression. The hidden data and the host image are absolutely recoverable from the embedded image without any loss."
medical,Automatic symmetry based cluster approach for anomalous brain   identification in PET scan image : An Analysis,"Medical image segmentation is referred to the segmentation of known anatomic structures from different medical images. Normally, the medical data researches are more complicated and an exclusive structures. This computer aided diagnosis is used for assisting doctors in evaluating medical imagery or in recognizing abnormal findings in a medical image. To integrate the specialized knowledge for medical data processing is helpful to form a real useful healthcare decision making system. This paper studies the different symmetry based distances applied in clustering algorithms and analyzes symmetry approach for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan image segmentation. Unlike CT and MRI, the PET scan identifies the structure of blood flow to and from organs. PET scan also helps in early diagnosis of cancer and heart, brain and gastro intestinal ailments and to detect the progress of treatment. In this paper, the scope diagnostic task expands for PET image in various brain functions."
medical,A Content Creation and Protection Scheme for Medical Images,"Medical images contain metadata information on where, when, and how an image was acquired, and the majority of this information is stored as pixel data. Image feature descriptions are often captured only as free text stored in the image file or in the hospital information system. Correlations between the free text and the location of the feature are often inaccurate, making it difficult to link image observations to their corresponding image locations. This limits the interpretation of image data from a clinical, research, and academic standpoint. An efficient medical image protection design should allow for compatibility, usability, and privacy. This paper proposes a medical-content creation and protection scheme that contains a) a DICOM-compatible multimedia annotation scheme for medical content creation; b) a DICOM-compatible partial DRM scheme for medical record transmission under this scheme, authorized users can view only information to which they have been granted to access."
medical,Using MapReduce for Large-scale Medical Image Analysis,"The growth of the amount of medical image data produced on a daily basis in modern hospitals forces the adaptation of traditional medical image analysis and indexing approaches towards scalable solutions. The number of images and their dimensionality increased dramatically during the past 20 years. We propose solutions for large-scale medical image analysis based on parallel computing and algorithm optimization. The MapReduce framework is used to speed up and make possible three large-scale medical image processing use-cases: (i) parameter optimization for lung texture segmentation using support vector machines, (ii) content-based medical image indexing, and (iii) three-dimensional directional wavelet analysis for solid texture classification. A cluster of heterogeneous computing nodes was set up in our institution using Hadoop allowing for a maximum of 42 concurrent map tasks. The majority of the machines used are desktop computers that are also used for regular office work. The cluster showed to be minimally invasive and stable. The runtimes of each of the three use-case have been significantly reduced when compared to a sequential execution. Hadoop provides an easy-to-employ framework for data analysis tasks that scales well for many tasks but requires optimization for specific tasks."
medical,Multi-layer Representation Learning for Medical Concepts,"Learning efficient representations for concepts has been proven to be an important basis for many applications such as machine translation or document classification. Proper representations of medical concepts such as diagnosis, medication, procedure codes and visits will have broad applications in healthcare analytics. However, in Electronic Health Records (EHR) the visit sequences of patients include multiple concepts (diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes) per visit. This structure provides two types of relational information, namely sequential order of visits and co-occurrence of the codes within each visit. In this work, we propose Med2Vec, which not only learns distributed representations for both medical codes and visits from a large EHR dataset with over 3 million visits, but also allows us to interpret the learned representations confirmed positively by clinical experts. In the experiments, Med2Vec displays significant improvement in key medical applications compared to popular baselines such as Skip-gram, GloVe and stacked autoencoder, while providing clinically meaningful interpretation."
medical,CNN-based Segmentation of Medical Imaging Data,"Convolutional neural networks have been applied to a wide variety of computer vision tasks. Recent advances in semantic segmentation have enabled their application to medical image segmentation. While most CNNs use two-dimensional kernels, recent CNN-based publications on medical image segmentation featured three-dimensional kernels, allowing full access to the three-dimensional structure of medical images. Though closely related to semantic segmentation, medical image segmentation includes specific challenges that need to be addressed, such as the scarcity of labelled data, the high class imbalance found in the ground truth and the high memory demand of three-dimensional images. In this work, a CNN-based method with three-dimensional filters is demonstrated and applied to hand and brain MRI. Two modifications to an existing CNN architecture are discussed, along with methods on addressing the aforementioned challenges. While most of the existing literature on medical image segmentation focuses on soft tissue and the major organs, this work is validated on data both from the central nervous system as well as the bones of the hand."
medical,Medical Image Retrieval using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"With a widespread use of digital imaging data in hospitals, the size of medical image repositories is increasing rapidly. This causes difficulty in managing and querying these large databases leading to the need of content based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) systems. A major challenge in CBMIR systems is the semantic gap that exists between the low level visual information captured by imaging devices and high level semantic information perceived by human. The efficacy of such systems is more crucial in terms of feature representations that can characterize the high-level information completely. In this paper, we propose a framework of deep learning for CBMIR system by using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained for classification of medical images. An intermodal dataset that contains twenty four classes and five modalities is used to train the network. The learned features and the classification results are used to retrieve medical images. For retrieval, best results are achieved when class based predictions are used. An average classification accuracy of 99.77% and a mean average precision of 0.69 is achieved for retrieval task. The proposed method is best suited to retrieve multimodal medical images for different body organs."
medical,Learning and inference in knowledge-based probabilistic model for   medical diagnosis,"Based on a weighted knowledge graph to represent first-order knowledge and combining it with a probabilistic model, we propose a methodology for the creation of a medical knowledge network (MKN) in medical diagnosis. When a set of symptoms is activated for a specific patient, we can generate a ground medical knowledge network composed of symptom nodes and potential disease nodes. By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN. In order to deal with numerical symptoms, a multivariate inference model is presented that uses conditional probability. In addition, the weights for the knowledge graph were efficiently learned from manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs). In our experiments, we found numerically that the optimum choice of the quality of disease node and the expression of symptom variable can improve the effectiveness of medical diagnosis. Our experimental results comparing a Markov logic network and the logistic regression algorithm on an actual CEMR database indicate that our method holds promise and that MKN can facilitate studies of intelligent diagnosis."
medical,"Deep Learning for Medical Image Processing: Overview, Challenges and   Future","Healthcare sector is totally different from other industry. It is on high priority sector and people expect highest level of care and services regardless of cost. It did not achieve social expectation even though it consume huge percentage of budget. Mostly the interpretations of medical data is being done by medical expert. In terms of image interpretation by human expert, it is quite limited due to its subjectivity, the complexity of the image, extensive variations exist across different interpreters, and fatigue. After the success of deep learning in other real world application, it is also providing exciting solutions with good accuracy for medical imaging and is seen as a key method for future applications in health secotr. In this chapter, we discussed state of the art deep learning architecture and its optimization used for medical image segmentation and classification. In the last section, we have discussed the challenges deep learning based methods for medical imaging and open research issue."
medical,Prediction of Individual Outcomes for Asthma Sufferers,"We consider the problem of individual-specific medication level recommendation (initiation, removal, increase, or decrease) for asthma sufferers. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in both adults and children, affecting 8% of the US population and costing $37-63 billion/year in the US. Asthma is a complex disease, whose symptoms may wax and wane, making it difficult for clinicians to predict outcomes and prognosis. Improved ability to predict prognosis can inform decision making and may promote conversations between clinician and provider around optimizing medication therapy. Data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) years 2000-2010 were used to fit a longitudinal model for a multivariate response of adverse events (Emergency Department or In-patient visits, excessive rescue inhaler use, and oral steroid use). To reduce bias in the estimation of medication effects, medication level was treated as a latent process which was restricted to be consistent with prescription refill data. This approach is demonstrated to be effective in the MEPS cohort via predictions on a validation hold out set and a synthetic data simulation study. This framework can be easily generalized to medication decisions for other conditions as well."
medical,Recent Developments and Future Challenges in Medical Mixed Reality,"Mixed Reality (MR) is of increasing interest within technology-driven modern medicine but is not yet used in everyday practice. This situation is changing rapidly, however, and this paper explores the emergence of MR technology and the importance of its utility within medical applications. A classification of medical MR has been obtained by applying an unbiased text mining method to a database of 1,403 relevant research papers published over the last two decades. The classification results reveal a taxonomy for the development of medical MR research during this period as well as suggesting future trends. We then use the classification to analyse the technology and applications developed in the last five years. Our objective is to aid researchers to focus on the areas where technology advancements in medical MR are most needed, as well as providing medical practitioners with a useful source of reference."
medical,Medication non adherence: finding solutions through design thinking   approach,"Medical non-adherence increasingly is recognized as a major medical health problem. Approximately 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed and such poor adherence has been shown to result in complications, death, and increased health care costs. This problem becomes even more significant for patients with chronic illness and those who need to take medications lifetime, like transplant patients. Studies show that one-half of rejection episodes and 15% of graft losses happen due to immunosuppression medications non-adherence. This article explores factors that have an impact on non-compliant behavior among transplant patients: patient factors, illness factor, therapeutic regimen factors. Using user-centered design thinking approach a set of hypotheses are defined and discussed strategies to enhance adherence by using mobile technology and gamification techniques."

We have combined an iterative learning approach and an encoder-decoder network to improve segmentation results, which enables to precisely localize the regions of interest (ROIs) including complex shapes or detailed textures of medical images in an iterative manner. The proposed iterative deep convolutional encoder-decoder network consists of two main paths: convolutional encoder path and convolutional decoder path with iterative learning. Experimental results show that the proposed iterative deep learning framework is able to yield excellent medical image segmentation performances for various medical images. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been proved by comparing with other state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods."

Achieving this segmentation automatically has been an active area of research, but the task has been proven very challenging due to the large variation of anatomy across different patients. However, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to significantly improve the performance of image recognition and semantic segmentation methods in the field of computer vision. Due to the data driven approaches of hierarchical feature learning in deep learning frameworks, these advances can be translated to medical images without much difficulty. Several variations of deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to medical images. Especially fully convolutional architectures have been proven efficient for segmentation of 3D medical images. In this article, we describe how to build a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) that can process 3D images in order to produce automatic semantic segmentations. The model is trained and evaluated on a clinical computed tomography (CT) dataset and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-organ segmentation."
medical,A Conversational Interface to Improve Medication Adherence: Towards AI   Support in Patient's Treatment,"Medication adherence is of utmost importance for many chronic conditions, regardless of the disease type. Engaging patients in self-tracking their medication is a big challenge. One way to potentially reduce this burden is to use reminders to promote wellness throughout all stages of life and improve medication adherence. Chatbots have proven effectiveness in triggering users to engage in certain activity, such as medication adherence. In this paper, we discuss ""Roborto"", a chatbot to create an engaging interactive and intelligent environment for patients and assist in positive lifestyle modification. We introduce a way for healthcare providers to track patients adherence and intervene whenever necessary. We describe the health, technical and behavioural approaches to the problem of medication non-adherence and propose a diagnostic and decision support tool. The proposed study will be implemented and validated through a pilot experiment with users to measure the efficacy of the proposed approach."
medical,The Appliance Pervasive of Internet of Things in Healthcare Systems,"In fact, information systems are the foundation of new productivity sources, medical organizational forms, and erection of a global economy. IoT based healthcare systems play a significant role in ICT and have contribution in growth of medical information systems, which are underpinning of recent medical and economic development strategies. However, to take advantages of IoT, it is essential that medical enterprises and community should trust the IoT systems in terms of performance, security, privacy, reliability and return-on-investment, which are open challenges of current IoT systems. For heightening of healthcare system; tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients and medical objects are more essential. But due to the inadequate healthcare situation, medical environment, medical technologies and the unique requirements of some healthcare applications, the obtainable tools cannot meet them accurately. The tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients and healthcare actors activities in healthcare system are challenging research directions for IoT researchers. State-of-the-art IoT based healthcare system should be developed which ensure the safety of patients and other healthcare activities. With this manuscript, we elaborate the essential role of IoT in healthcare systems; immense prospects of Internet of things in healthcare systems; extensive aspect of the use of IoT is dissimilar among different healthcare components and finally the participation of IoT between the useful research and present realistic applications. IoT and few other modern technologies are still in underpinning stage; mainly in the healthcare system."
medical,OHMF: A Query Based Optimal Healthcare Medication Framework,"Today cloud computing infrastructure is largely being deployed in healthcare to access various healthcare services easily over the Internet on an as needed basis. The main advantage of healthcare cloud is that it can be used as a tool for patients, medical professionals and insurance providers, to query and coordinate among medical departments, organizations and other healthcare related hubs. Although healthcare cloud services can enable better medication process with high responsiveness, but the privacy and other requirements of the patients need to be ensured in the process. Patients medical data may be required by the medical professionals, hospitals, diagnostic centers for analysis and diagnosis. However, data privacy and service quality cannot be compromised. In other words, there may exist various service providers corresponding to a specific healthcare service. The main challenge is to find the appropriate providers that comply best with patients requirement. In this paper, we propose a query based optimal medication framework to support the patients healthcare service accessibility comprehensively with considerable response time. The framework accepts related healthcare queries in natural language through a comprehensive user-interface and then processes the input query through a first order logic based evaluation engine and finds all possible services satisfying the requirements. First order logic is used for modeling of user requirements and queries. The query evaluation engine is built using zChaff, a Boolean logic satisfiability solver. The efficacy and usability of the framework is evaluated with initial case studies on synthetic and real life healthcare cloud."
medical,"A Triple Helix Model of Medical Innovation: Supply, Demand, and   Technological Capabilities in terms of Medical Subject Headings","We develop a model of innovation that enables us to trace the interplay among three key dimensions of the innovation process: (i) demand of and (ii) supply for innovation, and (iii) technological capabilities available to generate innovation in the forms of products, processes, and services. Building on triple helix research, we use entropy statistics to elaborate an indicator of mutual information among these dimensions that can provide indication of reduction of uncertainty. To do so, we focus on the medical context, where uncertainty poses significant challenges to the governance of innovation. We use the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of MEDLINE/PubMed to identify publications classified within the categories ""Diseases"" (C), ""Drugs and Chemicals"" (D), ""Analytic, Diagnostic, and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment"" (E) and use these as knowledge representations of demand, supply, and technological capabilities, respectively. Three case-studies of medical research areas are used as representative 'entry perspectives' of the medical innovation process. These are: (i) human papilloma virus, (ii) RNA interference, and (iii) magnetic resonance imaging. We find statistically significant periods of synergy among demand, supply, and technological capabilities (C-D-E) that point to three-dimensional interactions as a fundamental perspective for the understanding and governance of the uncertainty associated with medical innovation. Among the pairwise configurations in these contexts, the demand-technological capabilities (C-E) provided the strongest link, followed by the supply-demand (D-C) and the supply-technological capabilities (D-E) channels."
medical,HTC Vive MeVisLab integration via OpenVR for medical applications,"Virtual Reality, an immersive technology that replicates an environment via computer-simulated reality, gets a lot of attention in the entertainment industry. However, VR has also great potential in other areas, like the medical domain, Examples are intervention planning, training and simulation. This is especially of use in medical operations, where an aesthetic outcome is important, like for facial surgeries. Alas, importing medical data into Virtual Reality devices is not necessarily trivial, in particular, when a direct connection to a proprietary application is desired. Moreover, most researcher do not build their medical applications from scratch, but rather leverage platforms like MeVisLab, MITK, OsiriX or 3D Slicer. These platforms have in common that they use libraries like ITK and VTK, and provide a convenient graphical interface. However, ITK and VTK do not support Virtual Reality directly. In this study, the usage of a Virtual Reality device for medical data under the MeVisLab platform is presented. The OpenVR library is integrated into the MeVisLab platform, allowing a direct and uncomplicated usage of the head mounted display HTC Vive inside the MeVisLab platform. Medical data coming from other MeVisLab modules can directly be connected per drag-and-drop to the Virtual Reality module, rendering the data inside the HTC Vive for immersive virtual reality inspection."

medical,"A Complex Data Warehouse for Personalized, Anticipative Medicine","With the growing use of new technologies, healthcare is nowadays undergoing significant changes. Information-based medicine has to exploit medical decision-support systems and requires the analysis of various, heterogeneous data, such as patient records, medical images, biological analysis results, etc. In this paper, we present the design of the complex data warehouse relating to high-level athletes. It is original in two ways. First, it is aimed at storing complex medical data. Second, it is designed to allow innovative and quite different kinds of analyses to support: (1) personalized and anticipative medicine (in opposition to curative medicine) for well-identified patients; (2) broad-band statistical studies over a given population of patients. Furthermore, the system includes data relating to several medical fields. It is also designed to be evolutionary to take into account future advances in medical research."

The evolutions in terms of general design and control paradigms in the development of medical robots are presented and issues specific to that application domain are discussed. A view of existing systems, on-going developments and future trends is given. A case-study is detailed.

medical,Dynamically Generated Interfaces in XML Based Architecture,"Providing on-line services on the Internet will require the definition of flexible interfaces that are capable of adapting to the user's characteristics. This is all the more important in the context of medical applications like home monitoring, where no two patients have the same medical profile. Still, the problem is not limited to the capacity of defining generic interfaces, as has been made possible by UIML, but also to define the underlying information structures from which these may be generated. The DIATELIC project deals with the tele-monitoring of patients under peritoneal dialysis. By means of XML abstractions, termed as ""medical components"", to represent the patient's profile, the application configures the customizable properties of the patient's interface and generates a UIML document dynamically. The interface allows the patient to feed the data manually or use a device which allows ""automatic data acquisition"". The acquired medical data is transferred to an expert system, which analyses the data and sends alerts to the medical staff. In this paper we show how UIML can be seen as one component within a global XML based architecture."
medical,From individual to population: Challenges in Medical Visualization,"In this paper, we first give a high-level overview of medical visualization development over the past 30 years, focusing on key developments and the trends that they represent. During this discussion, we will refer to a number of key papers that we have also arranged on the medical visualization research timeline. Based on the overview and our observations of the field, we then identify and discuss the medical visualization research challenges that we foresee for the coming decade."
medical,Securing Medical Images by Watermarking Using DWT DCT and SVD,"Telemedicine is well known application where enormous amount of medical data need to be transferred securely over network and manipulate effectively. Security of digital data, especially medical images, becomes important for many reasons such as confidentiality, authentication and integrity. Digital watermarking has emerged as a advanced technology to enhance the security of digital images. The insertion of watermark in medical images can authenticate it and guarantee its integrity. The watermark must be generally hidden does not affect the quality of the medical image. In this paper, we propose blind watermarking based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we compare the performance of this technique with watermarking based DWT and SVD. The proposed method DWT, DCT and SVD comparatively better than DWT and SVD method."
medical,Bibliometric Perspectives on Medical Innovation using the Medical   Subject Headings (MeSH) of PubMed,"Multiple perspectives on the nonlinear processes of medical innovations can be distinguished and combined using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the Medline database. Focusing on three main branches-""diseases,"" ""drugs and chemicals,"" and ""techniques and equipment""-we use base maps and overlay techniques to investigate the translations and interactions and thus to gain a bibliometric perspective on the dynamics of medical innovations. To this end, we first analyze the Medline database, the MeSH index tree, and the various options for a static mapping from different perspectives and at different levels of aggregation. Following a specific innovation (RNA interference) over time, the notion of a trajectory which leaves a signature in the database is elaborated. Can the detailed index terms describing the dynamics of research be used to predict the diffusion dynamics of research results? Possibilities are specified for further integration between the Medline database, on the one hand, and the Science Citation Index and Scopus (containing citation information), on the other."
medical,Coupling Clinical Decision Support System with Computerized Prescriber   Order Entry and their Dynamic Plugging in the Medical Workflow System,"This work deals with coupling Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) with Computerized Prescriber Order Entry (CPOE) and their dynamic plugging in the medical Workflow Management System (WfMS). First, in this paper we argue some existing CDSS representative of the state of the art in order to emphasize their inability to deal with coupling with CPOE and medical WfMS. The multi-agent technology is at the basis of our proposition since (i) it provides natural abstractions to deal with distribution, heterogeneity and autonomy which are inherent to the previous systems (CDSS, CPOE and medical WfMS), and (ii) it introduces powerful concepts such as organizations, goals and roles useful to describe in details the coordination of the different components involved in these systems. In this paper, we also propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to support the coupling CDSS with CPOE. Finally, we show how we integrate the proposed MAS in the medical workflow management system which is also based on collaborating agents"
medical,Extending UML for Conceptual Modeling of Annotation of Medical Images,"Imaging has occupied a huge role in the management of patients, whether hospitalized or not. Depending on the patients clinical problem, a variety of imaging modalities were available for use. This gave birth of the annotation of medical image process. The annotation is intended to image analysis and solve the problem of semantic gap. The reason for image annotation is due to increase in acquisition of images. Physicians and radiologists feel better while using annotation techniques for faster remedy in surgery and medicine due to the following reasons: giving details to the patients, searching the present and past records from the larger databases, and giving solutions to them in a faster and more accurate way. However, classical conceptual modeling does not incorporate the specificity of medical domain specially the annotation of medical image. The design phase is the most important activity in the successful building of annotation process. For this reason, we focus in this paper on presenting the conceptual modeling of the annotation of medical image by defining a new profile using the StarUML extensibility mechanism."
medical,An Approach to Find Missing Values in Medical Datasets,"Mining medical datasets is a challenging problem before data mining researchers as these datasets have several hidden challenges compared to conventional datasets.Starting from the collection of samples through field experiments and clinical trials to performing classification,there are numerous challenges at every stage in the mining process. The preprocessing phase in the mining process itself is a challenging issue when, we work on medical datasets. One of the prime challenges in mining medical datasets is handling missing values which is part of preprocessing phase. In this paper, we address the issue of handling missing values in medical dataset consisting of categorical attribute values. The main contribution of this research is to use the proposed imputation measure to estimate and fix the missing values. We discuss a case study to demonstrate the working of proposed measure."
medical,Feature selection in detection of adverse drug reactions from the Health   Improvement Network (THIN) database,"Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is widely concerned for public health issue. ADRs are one of most common causes to withdraw some drugs from market. Prescription event monitoring (PEM) is an important approach to detect the adverse drug reactions. The main problem to deal with this method is how to automatically extract the medical events or side effects from high-throughput medical events, which are collected from day to day clinical practice. In this study we propose a novel concept of feature matrix to detect the ADRs. Feature matrix, which is extracted from big medical data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, is created to characterize the medical events for the patients who take drugs. Feature matrix builds the foundation for the irregular and big medical data. Then feature selection methods are performed on feature matrix to detect the significant features. Finally the ADRs can be located based on the significant features. The experiments are carried out on three drugs: Atorvastatin, Alendronate, and Metoclopramide. Major side effects for each drug are detected and better performance is achieved compared to other computerized methods. The detected ADRs are based on computerized methods, further investigation is needed."
medical,DAPriv: Decentralized architecture for preserving the privacy of medical   data,"The digitization of the medical data has been a sensitive topic. In modern times laws such as the HIPAA provide some guidelines for electronic transactions in medical data to prevent attacks and fraudulent usage of private information. In our paper, we explore an architecture that uses hybrid computing with decentralized key management and show how it is suitable in preventing a special form of re-identification attack that we name as the re-assembly attack. This architecture would be able to use current infrastructure from mobile phones to server certificates and cloud based decentralized storage models in an efficient way to provide a reliable model for communication of medical data. We encompass entities including patients, doctors, insurance agents, emergency contacts, researchers, medical test laboratories and technicians. This is a complete architecture that provides patients with a good level of privacy, secure communication and more direct control."
medical,Shaping the Future through Innovations: From Medical Imaging to   Precision Medicine,"Medical images constitute a source of information essential for disease diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. In addition, due to its patient-specific nature, imaging information represents a critical component required for advancing precision medicine into clinical practice. This manuscript describes recently developed technologies for better handling of image information: photorealistic visualization of medical images with Cinematic Rendering, artificial agents for in-depth image understanding, support for minimally invasive procedures, and patient-specific computational models with enhanced predictive power. Throughout the manuscript we will analyze the capabilities of such technologies and extrapolate on their potential impact to advance the quality of medical care, while reducing its cost."
medical,A Novel Framework for Electronic Global Health Record Access,"When most patients visit physicians in a clinic or a hospital, they are asked about their medical history and related medical tests' results which might not exist or might simply have been lost over time. In emergency situations, many patients suffer or sadly die because of lack of pertinent medical information. Patient's Health information (PHI) saved by Electronic Medical Record (EMR) could be accessible only by a hospital using their EMR system. Furthermore, Personal Health Record (PHR) information cannot be solely relied on since it is controlled solely by patients. This paper introduces a novel framework for accessing, sharing, and controlling the medical records for patients and their physicians globally, while patients' PHI are securely stored and their privacy is taken into consideration. Based on the framework, a proof of concept prototype is implemented. Preliminary performance evaluation results indicate the validity and viability of the proposed framework."
medical,An Interactive Medical Image Segmentation Framework Using Iterative   Refinement,"Image segmentation is often performed on medical images for identifying diseases in clinical evaluation. Hence it has become one of the major research areas. Conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain irregularities. They need to be pre-processed before segmentation. In order to obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose a two stage algorithm. The first stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. This marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut on the input image thus resulting in an efficient segmented result. The obtained result can be further refined by user interaction which can be done using the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate and provides satisfactory segmentation results with minimum user interaction on medical as well as natural images."
medical,Stacked Autoencoders for Medical Image Search,"Medical images can be a valuable resource for reliable information to support medical diagnosis. However, the large volume of medical images makes it challenging to retrieve relevant information given a particular scenario. To solve this challenge, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) attempts to characterize images (or image regions) with invariant content information in order to facilitate image search. This work presents a feature extraction technique for medical images using stacked autoencoders, which encode images to binary vectors. The technique is applied to the IRMA dataset, a collection of 14,410 x-ray images in order to demonstrate the ability of autoencoders to retrieve similar x-rays given test queries. Using IRMA dataset as a benchmark, it was found that stacked autoencoders gave excellent results with a retrieval error of 376 for 1,733 test images with a compression of 74.61%."
medical,Exploiting Convolutional Neural Network for Risk Prediction with Medical   Feature Embedding,"The widespread availability of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to usher in the era of personalized medicine. However, the problem of extracting useful clinical representations from longitudinal EHR data remains challenging. In this paper, we explore deep neural network models with learned medical feature embedding to deal with the problems of high dimensionality and temporality. Specifically, we use a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to parameterize the model and is thus able to capture complex non-linear longitudinal evolution of EHRs. Our model can effectively capture local/short temporal dependency in EHRs, which is beneficial for risk prediction. To account for high dimensionality, we use the embedding medical features in the CNN model which hold the natural medical concepts. Our initial experiments produce promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of both the medical feature embedding and the proposed convolutional neural network in risk prediction on cohorts of congestive heart failure and diabetes patients compared with several strong baselines."
medical,Fuzzy Approach Topic Discovery in Health and Medical Corpora,"The majority of medical documents and electronic health records (EHRs) are in text format that poses a challenge for data processing and finding relevant documents. Looking for ways to automatically retrieve the enormous amount of health and medical knowledge has always been an intriguing topic. Powerful methods have been developed in recent years to make the text processing automatic. One of the popular approaches to retrieve information based on discovering the themes in health & medical corpora is topic modeling, however, this approach still needs new perspectives. In this research we describe fuzzy latent semantic analysis (FLSA), a novel approach in topic modeling using fuzzy perspective. FLSA can handle health & medical corpora redundancy issue and provides a new method to estimate the number of topics. The quantitative evaluations show that FLSA produces superior performance and features to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the most popular topic model."
medical,Modality-bridge Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification,"This paper presents a new approach of transfer learning-based medical image classification to mitigate insufficient labeled data problem in medical domain. Instead of direct transfer learning from source to small number of labeled target data, we propose a modality-bridge transfer learning which employs the bridge database in the same medical imaging acquisition modality as target database. By learning the projection function from source to bridge and from bridge to target, the domain difference between source (e.g., natural images) and target (e.g., X-ray images) can be mitigated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a high classification performance even for a small number of labeled target medical images, compared to various transfer learning approaches."
medical,On the Automatic Generation of Medical Imaging Reports,"Medical imaging is widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis and treatment. Specialized physicians read medical images and write textual reports to narrate the findings. Report-writing can be error-prone for unexperienced physicians, and time-consuming and tedious for physicians in highly populated nations. To address these issues, we study the automatic generation of medical imaging reports, as an assistance for human physicians in producing reports more accurately and efficiently. This task presents several challenges. First, a complete report contains multiple heterogeneous forms of information, including findings which are paragraphs and tags which are a list of key words. Second, abnormal regions in medical images are difficult to identify. Generating textual narrations for them is even harder. Third, the reports are typically long, containing multiple paragraphs. To cope with these challenges, we (1) build a multi-task learning framework which jointly performs the prediction of tags and the generation of paragraphs, (2) propose a co-attention mechanism to localize regions containing abnormalities and generate narrations for them, (3) develop a hierarchical LSTM model to generate long para- graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a chest x-ray dataset and a pathology dataset."
medical,A Model for Medical Diagnosis Based on Plantar Pressure,"The process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs can be very complicated and may be inaccurate in some cases. The general belief is that diagnosing diseases relies on doctors' keen intuition, rich experience and professional equipment. In this work, we employ ideas from recent advances in plantar pressure research and from the powerful capacity of the convolutional neural network for learning representations. Here, we propose a model using convolutional neural network based on plantar pressure for medical diagnosis. Our model learns a network that maps plantar pressure data to its corresponding medical diagnostic label. We then apply our model to make the medical diagnosis on datasets we collected from cooperative hospital and achieve an accuracy of 98.36%. We demonstrate that the model base on the convolutional neural network is competitive in medical diagnosis."

The HPC parallel implementation overcomes the limits due to the great amount of data and the complexity of data processing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the U-BRAIN parallel implementation as defect classifier in aerospace structures. The resulting system is implemented on a Linux-based cluster with multi-core architecture."
aerospace,A Hybrid Model of a Genetic Regulatory Network in Mammalian Sclera,"Myopia in human and animals is caused by the axial elongation of the eye and is closely linked to the thinning of the sclera which supports the eye tissue. This thinning has been correlated with the overproduction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2), an enzyme that degrades the collagen structure of the sclera. In this short paper, we propose a descriptive model of a regulatory network with hysteresis, which seems necessary for creating oscillatory behavior in the hybrid model between MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Numerical results provide insight on the type of equilibria present in the system."

In this paper, optimal maneuvers are obtained for an autonomous aircraft by solving a time domain model-based optimum experimental design problem that aims to obtain more accurate parameter estimates while enforcing safety constraints.The optimized inputs are compared with respect to conventional maneuvers widely used in the aerospace field and tested within real experiments."

aerospace,Metallicity and effective temperature of the secondary of RS Oph,"The recurrent nova RS Oph undergoes nova eruptions every ~ 10-20years as a result of thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit. Both the progress of the eruption, and its aftermath, depend on the (poorly known) composition of the red giant in the RS Oph system. Our aim is to understand better the effect of the giant secondary on the recurrent nova eruption. Synthetic spectra were computed for a grid of M-giant model atmospheres having a range of effective temperatures 3200 < Teff < 4400 K, gravities 0 < log g < 1 and abundances -4 <[Fe/H] < 0.5, and fit to infrared spectra of RS Oph as it returned to quiescence after its 2006 eruption. We have modelled the infrared spectrum in the range 1.4-2.5 micron to determine metallicity and effective temperature of the red giant. We find Teff = 4100 +/- 100 K, log g = 0.0 +/- 0.5, [Fe/H] = 0.0 +/- 0.5, [C/H] = -0.8 +/- 0.2, [N/H] = +0.6 +/- 0.3 in the atmosphere of the secondary, and demonstrate that that inclusion of some dust `veiling' in the spectra cannot improve our fits."

The data analyzed cover the period from January 1987 to April 1999. We present a new index for the aerospace sector and we investigate the statistical characteristics of this index. Our results show that this index is well described by Tsallis distribution. We explore this result and modify the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR), financial risk assessment methodology in order to reflect an asset which obeys Tsallis non-extensive statistics."
aerospace,Temperature restrictions for materials used in aerospace industry for   the near-sun orbits,"For near-Sun missions, the spacecraft approaches very close to the Sun and space environmental effects become relevant. Strong restrictions on how much close it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials can stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and functionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given mission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The temperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties: reflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is considered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are constant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the temperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the aerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on the heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical properties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly proportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as $r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the same temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and, eventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun without compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace structures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of composite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity - are defined."

aerospace,Evocation and elaboration of solutions: Different types of   problem-solving actions. An empirical study on the design of an aerospace   artifact,"An observational study was conducted on a professional designer working on a design project in aerospace industry. The protocol data were analyzed in order to gain insight into the actions the designer used for the development of a solution to the corresponding problem. Different processes are described: from the ""simple"" evocation of a solution existing in memory, to the elaboration of a ""new"" solution out of mnesic entities without any clear link to the current problem. Control is addressed in so far as it concerns the priority among the different types of development processes: the progression from evocation of a ""standard"" solution to elaboration of a ""new"" solution is supposed to correspond to the resulting order, that is, the one in which the designer's activity proceeds. Short discussions of * the double status of ""problem"" and ""solution,"" * the problem/solution knowledge units in memory and their access, and * the different abstraction levels on which problem and solution representations are developed, are illustrated by the results."
aerospace,Relativistic description of the double P-wave charmonium production in   e^+e^- annihilation,On the basis of perturbative QCD and the relativistic quark model we calculate relativistic and bound state corrections in the production processes of a pair of P-wave charmonium states. Relativistic factors in the production amplitude connected with the relative motion of heavy quarks and the transformation law of the bound state wave function to the reference frame of the moving P-wave mesons are taken into account. For the gluon and quark propagators entering the production vertex function we use a truncated expansion in the ratio of the relative quark momenta to the center-of-mass energy sqrt{s} up to the second order. Relativistic corrections to the quark bound state wave functions in the rest frame are considered by means of the Breit-like potential. It turns out that the examined effects change essentially the nonrelativistic results of the cross section for the reaction e^++e^-\to h_c+\chi_{cJ} at the center-of-mass energy sqrt{s}=10.6 GeV.
aerospace,Robust Topology Optimization of Truss with regard to Volume,"A common problem in the optimization of structures is the handling of uncertainties in the parameters. If the parameters appear in the constraints, the uncertainties can lead to an infinite number of constraints. Usually the constraints have to be approximated by finite expressions to generate a computable problem. Here, using the example of the topology optimization of a truss, a method is proposed to deal with such uncertainties by using robust optimization techniques, leading to an approach without the necessity of any approximation. With adequately chosen load cases, the final expression is equivalent to the multiple load case. Simple numerical examples of typical problems illustrate the application of the method."

Relativistic corrections to the quark-quark bound state wave functions in the rest frame are considered by means of the Breit-like potential. It turns out that the examined effects significantly decrease nonrelativistic cross sections.
aerospace,Design of a silica-aerogel-based cosmic dust collector for the Tanpopo   mission aboard the International Space Station,"We are developing a silica-aerogel-based cosmic dust collector for use in the Tanpopo experiment to be conducted on the International Space Station. The mass production of simple two-layer hydrophobic aerogels was undertaken in a contamination-controlled environment, yielding more than 100 undamaged products. The collector, comprising an aerogel tile and holder panel, was designed to resist launch vibration and to conform to an exposure attachment. To this end, a box-framing aerogel with inner and outer densities of 0.01 and 0.03 g/cm$^3$, respectively, was fabricated. The aerogel mounted in the panel passed random vibration tests at the levels of the acceptance and qualification tests for launch. It also withstood the pressure changes expected in the airlock on the International Space Station."
aerospace,New AB-Thermonuclear Reactor for Aerospace,"There are two main methods of nulcear fusion: inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Existing thermonuclear reactors are very complex, expensive, large, and heavy. They cannot achieve the Lawson creterion.   The author offers an innovation. ICF has on the inside surface of the shell-shaped combustion chamber a covering of small Prism Reflectors (PR) and plasma reflector. These prism reflectors have a noteworthy advantage, in comparison with conventional mirror and especially with conventional shell: they multi-reflect the heat and laser radiation exactly back into collision with the fuel target capsule (pellet). The plasma reflector reflects the Bremsstrahlung radiation.   The offered innovation decreases radiation losses, creates significant radiation pressure and increases the reaction time. The Lawson criterion increases by hundreds of times. The size, cost, and weight of a typical installation will decrease by tens of times.   The author is researching the efficiency of these innovations. Keywords: Thermonuclear reactor, Multi-reflex AB-thermonuclear reactor, aerospace thermonuclear engine.

aerospace,Developing Experimental Models for NASA Missions with ASSL,"NASA's new age of space exploration augurs great promise for deep space exploration missions whereby spacecraft should be independent, autonomous, and smart. Nowadays NASA increasingly relies on the concepts of autonomic computing, exploiting these to increase the survivability of remote missions, particularly when human tending is not feasible. Autonomic computing has been recognized as a promising approach to the development of self-managing spacecraft systems that employ onboard intelligence and rely less on control links. The Autonomic System Specification Language (ASSL) is a framework for formally specifying and generating autonomic systems. As part of long-term research targeted at the development of models for space exploration missions that rely on principles of autonomic computing, we have employed ASSL to develop formal models and generate functional prototypes for NASA missions. This helps to validate features and perform experiments through simulation. Here, we discuss our work on developing such missions with ASSL."

aerospace,Anisotropic Boundary Layer Adaptivity of Multi-Element Wings,"Multi-element wings are popular in the aerospace community due to their high lift performance. Turbulent flow simulations of these configurations require very fine mesh spacings especially near the walls, thereby making use of a boundary layer mesh necessary. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the required mesh resolution a priori to the simulations. In this paper we use an anisotropic adaptive meshing approach including adaptive control of elements in the boundary layers and study its effectiveness for two multi-element wing configurations. The results are compared with experimental data as well as nested refinements to show the efficiency of adaptivity driven by error indicators, where superior resolution in wakes and near the tip region through adaptivity are highlighted."
aerospace,Velocity/Position Integration Formula (I): Application to In-flight   Coarse Alignment,"The in-flight alignment is a critical stage for airborne INS/GPS applications. The alignment task is usually carried out by the Kalman filtering technique that necessitates a good initial attitude to obtain satisfying performance. Due to the airborne dynamics, the in-flight alignment is much difficult than alignment on the ground. This paper proposes an optimization-based coarse alignment approach using GPS position/velocity as input, founded on the newly-derived velocity/position integration formulae. Simulation and flight test results show that, with the GPS lever arm well handled, it is potentially able to yield the initial heading up to one degree accuracy in ten seconds. It can serve as a nice coarse in-flight alignment without any prior attitude information for the subsequent fine Kalman alignment. The approach can also be applied to other applications that require aligning the INS on the run."
aerospace,Velocity/Position Integration Formula (II): Application to Inertial   Navigation Computation,"Inertial navigation applications are usually referenced to a rotating frame. Consideration of the navigation reference frame rotation in the inertial navigation algorithm design is an important but so far less seriously treated issue, especially for ultra-high-speed flying aircraft or the future ultra-precision navigation system of several meters per hour. This paper proposes a rigorous approach to tackle the issue of navigation frame rotation in velocity/position computation by use of the newly-devised velocity/position integration formulae in the Part I companion paper. The two integration formulae set a well-founded cornerstone for the velocity/position algorithms design that makes the comprehension of the inertial navigation computation principle more accessible to practitioners, and different approximations to the integrals involved will give birth to various velocity/position update algorithms. Two-sample velocity and position algorithms are derived to exemplify the design process. In the context of level-flight airplane examples, the derived algorithm is analytically and numerically compared to the typical algorithms existing in the literature. The results throw light on the problems in existing algorithms and the potential benefits of the derived algorithm."

Relativistic terms in the production amplitude connected with the relative motion of heavy quarks and the transformation law of the bound state wave functions to the reference frame of moving $J/\psi$ mesons are taken into account. For the gluon and quark propagators entering the amplitude we use a truncated expansion in relative quark momenta up to the second order. Relativistic corrections to the quark bound state wave functions are considered by means of the Breit-like potential. It turns out that the examined effects decrease initial nonrelativistic cross section more than two times. The final result lies below the experimental value measured by LHCb.

The goals of the pGAPS experiment were: to test the operation of lithium drifted silicon (Si(Li)) detectors at balloon altitudes, to validate the thermal model and cooling concept needed for engineering of a full-size GAPS instrument, and to characterize cosmic ray and X-ray backgrounds. The instrument was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan.

The gravity gradients contain useful position information which can be extracted by matching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman filter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of orbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are discussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to deal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to analyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights, attitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show that the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors. Degraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented state filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are used to test the algorithm. Radial and cross-track position errors of less than 100 m have been achieved."

The proposed method is based on the assumption that the defect is bound to the reaction of the probe coil impedance during the test. Impedance plane analysis is used to extract a feature vector from the shape of the coil impedance in the complex plane, through the use of some geometric parameters. Shape recognition is tested with three different machine-learning based classifiers: decision trees, neural networks and Naive Bayes. The performance of the proposed detection system are measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and Matthews correlation coefficient. Several experiments are performed on dataset of eddy current signal samples for aircraft structures. The obtained results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and the competiveness against existing descriptors."

The performance of the resulting detection systems are measured in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Precision. Their effectiveness is evaluated by the Matthews correlation, the Area Under Curve (AUC), and the F-Measure. Several experiments are performed on a standard dataset of eddy current signal samples for aircraft structures. Our experimental results evidence that the key to a successful defect classifier is the feature extraction method - namely the novel CBIR-based one outperforms all the competitors - and they illustrate the greater effectiveness of the U-BRAIN algorithm and the MLP neural network among the soft computing methods in this kind of application.

aerospace,Geometric Optimal Control and Applications to Aerospace,"This survey article deals with applications of optimal control to aerospace problems with a focus on modern geometric optimal control tools and numerical continuation techniques. Geometric optimal control is a theory combining optimal control with various concepts of differential geometry. The ultimate objective is to derive optimal synthesis results for general classes of control systems. Continuation or homotopy methods consist in solving a series of parameterized problems, starting from a simple one to end up by continuous deformation with the initial problem. They help overcoming the difficult initialization issues of the shooting method. The combination of geometric control and homotopy methods improves the traditional techniques of optimal control theory. A nonacademic example of optimal attitude-trajectory control of (classical and airborne) launch vehicles, treated in details, illustrates how geometric optimal control can be used to analyze finely the structure of the extremals. This theoretical analysis helps building an efficient numerical solution procedure combining shooting methods and numerical continuation. Chattering is also analyzed and it is shown how to deal with this issue in practice."
aerospace,"Dark solitons, modulation instability and breathers in a chain of weakly   non-linear oscillators with cyclic symmetry","In the aerospace industry the trend for light-weight structures and the resulting complex dynamic behaviours currently challenge vibration engineers. In many cases, these light-weight structures deviate from linear behaviour, and complex nonlinear phenomena can be expected. We consider a cyclically symmetric system of coupled weakly nonlinear undamped oscillators that could be considered a minimal model for different cyclic and symmetric aerospace structures experiencing large deformations. The focus is on localised vibrations that arise from wave envelope modulation of travelling waves. For the defocussing parameter range of the approximative nonlinear evolution equation, we show the possible existence of dark solitons and discuss their characteristics. For the focussing parameter range, we characterise modulation instability and illustrate corresponding nonlinear breather dynamics. Furthermore, we show that for stronger nonlinearity or randomness in initial conditions, transient breather-type dynamics and decay into bright solitons appear. The findings suggest that significant vibration localisation may arise due to mechanisms of nonlinear modulation dynamics."
aerospace,Precise Real-Time Navigation of LEO Satellites Using a Single-Frequency   GPS Receiver and Ultra-Rapid Ephemerides,"Precise (sub-meter level) real-time navigation using a space-capable single-frequency global positioning system (GPS) receiver and ultra-rapid (real-time) ephemerides from the international global navigation satellite systems service is proposed for low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites. The C/A code and L1 carrier phase measurements are combined and single-differenced to eliminate first-order ionospheric effects and receiver clock offsets. A random-walk process is employed to model the phase ambiguities in order to absorb the time-varying and satellite-specific higher-order measurement errors as well as the GPS clock correction errors. A sequential Kalman filter which incorporates the known orbital dynamic model is developed to estimate orbital states and phase ambiguities without matrix inversion. Real flight data from the single-frequency GPS receiver onboard China's SJ-9A small satellite are processed to evaluate the orbit determination accuracy. Statistics from internal orbit assessments indicate that three-dimensional accuracies of better than 0.50 m and 0.55 mm/s are achieved for position and velocity, respectively."

As a legacy platform, MIL-STD-1553 was designed for high level of fault tolerance while less attention was taken with regard to security. Recent studies already addressed the impact of successful cyber attacks on aerospace vehicles that are implementing MIL-STD-1553. In this study we present a security analysis of MIL-STD-1553. In addition, we present a method for anomaly detection in MIL-STD-1553 communication bus and its performance in the presence of several attack scenarios implemented in a testbed, as well as results on real system data. Moreover, we propose a general approach towards an intrusion detection system (IDS) for a MIL-STD-1553 communication bus."
aerospace,Model Rocket Project for Aerospace Engineering Course: Trajectory   Simulation and Propellant Analysis,"Model rockets have been employed in student projects, but very few papers in aerospace education offer concise summaries of activities at university-course levels. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. The rockets used by our students reached some 500 m (~1,640 feet) in altitude, deployed a parachute, and spent 2-3 minutes descending to the ground. We present a series of analyses and experiments that students performed in order to predict the flight time, the maximum altitude, and the landing location of these rockets. They wrote computer programs to numerically integrate equations of motion, and experimentally measured input parameters (e.g., the thrust profile and drag coefficients). Once launched, these rockets could not be controlled; targeting the landing location would thus mean tilting the launch rail to a required angle. The largest source of error in landing location came from the difficulty in modeling wind velocities. Also discussed in this paper are the infrared spectroscopy and the extraction experiment as novel additions to model rocket projects."

A key source of such uncertainties in design are the closure models used to account for fluid turbulence. In spite of their importance, no reliable and extensively tested modules are available to estimate this epistemic uncertainty. In this article, we outline the EQUiPS uncertainty estimation module developed for the SU2 CFD suite that focuses on uncertainty due to turbulence models. The theoretical foundations underlying this uncertainty estimation and its computational implementation are detailed. Thence, the performance of this module is presented for a range of test cases, including both benchmark problems and flows relevant to aerospace design.

aerospace,A Generalization of the Theory of Normal Forms,"Normal forms allow the use of a restricted class of coordinate transformations (typically homogeneous polynomials) to put the bifurcations found in nonlinear dynamical systems into a few standard forms. We investigate here the consequences of relaxing the restrictions of the form of the coordinate transformations. In the Duffing equation, a logarithmic transformation can remove the nonlinearity: in one interpretation, the nonlinearity is replaced by a branch cut leading to a Poincare section. When the linearized problem is autonomous with diagonal Jordan form, we can remove all nonlinearities order by order using these singular coordinate transformations."

An RHM represents the spatial extent by means of randomly scaled versions of the shape boundary. In doing so, the shape parameters and the measurements are related via a measurement equation that serves as the basis for a Gaussian state estimator. Specific estimators are derived for elliptic and star-convex shapes."
aerospace,Wireless Transmission of Video for Biomechanical Analysis,"When there is a possibility to wirelessly stream video over a network, a sophisticated computer analysis of the transmitted video is possible. Such process is used in biomechanics when it is important to analyze athletes performance via streaming digital uncompressed video to a computer and then analyzing it using specific software such as Arial Performance Analysis Systems or Dartfish. This manuscript presents some approaches and challenges in streaming video as well as some applications of Information Technology in biomechanics. An example of how scientists from Indiana State University approached the wireless transmission of video is also introduced."
aerospace,Automation Security,"Web-based Automated Process Control systems are a new type of applications that use the Internet to control industrial processes with the access to the real-time data. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks contain computers and applications that perform key functions in providing essential services and commodities (e.g., electricity, natural gas, gasoline, water, waste treatment, transportation) to all Americans. As such, they are part of the nation s critical infrastructure and require protection from a variety of threats that exist in cyber space today."
aerospace,Unsupervised Learning in Neuromemristive Systems,"Neuromemristive systems (NMSs) currently represent the most promising platform to achieve energy efficient neuro-inspired computation. However, since the research field is less than a decade old, there are still countless algorithms and design paradigms to be explored within these systems. One particular domain that remains to be fully investigated within NMSs is unsupervised learning. In this work, we explore the design of an NMS for unsupervised clustering, which is a critical element of several machine learning algorithms. Using a simple memristor crossbar architecture and learning rule, we are able to achieve performance which is on par with MATLAB's k-means clustering."
aerospace,Closed-Loop Estimation of Oscillator g-Sensitivity in a GNSS/IMU System,"We propose a simple method for estimating crystal oscillator g-sensitivity in inertially aided Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. It does not require any specific equipment, like GNSS signal simulators or rate tables. The method is based on analyzing closed-loop phase tracking errors. This enables us to utilize the actual GNSS signal as the frequency reference, despite the presence of an unknown Doppler shift in it. The method has been successfully applied to the calibration of an oven-controlled crystal oscillator."
aerospace,"Split, Send, Reassemble: A Formal Specification of a CAN Bus Protocol   Stack","We present a formal model for a fragmentation and a reassembly protocol running on top of the standardised CAN bus, which is widely used in automotive and aerospace applications. Although the CAN bus comes with an in-built mechanism for prioritisation, we argue that this is not sufficient and provide another protocol to overcome this shortcoming."
aerospace,Autoignition of Butanol Isomers at Low to Intermediate Temperature and   Elevated Pressure,"Autoignition delay experiments for the isomers of butanol, including n-, sec-, tert-, and iso-butanol, have been performed using a heated rapid compression machine. For a compressed pressure of 15 bar, the compressed temperatures have been varied in the range of 725-855 K for all the stoichiometric fuel/oxidizer mixtures. Over the conditions investigated in this study, the ignition delay decreases monotonically as temperature increases and exhibits single-stage characteristics. Experimental ignition delays are also compared to simulations computed using three kinetic mechanisms available in the literature. Reasonable agreement is found for three isomers (tert-, iso-, and n-butanol)."
aerospace,Geometric Decomposition-Based Formulation for Time Derivatives of   Instantaneous Impact Point,"A new analytic formulation to express the time derivatives of the instantaneous impact point (IIP) of a rocket is proposed. The geometric relationship on a plane tangential to the IIP is utilized to decompose the inertial IIP rate vector into the downrange and crossrange components, and a systematic procedure to determine the component values is presented. The new formulation shows significant advantages over the existing formulation such that the procedure and final expressions for the IIP derivatives are easy to understand and more compact. The validity of the proposed formulation was demonstrated through numerical simulation."
aerospace,Near Time-Optimal Feedback Instantaneous Impact Point (IIP) Guidance Law   for Rocket,"This paper proposes a feedback guidance law to move the instantaneous impact point (IIP) of a rocket to a desired location. Analytic expressions relating the time derivatives of an IIP with the external acceleration of the rocket are introduced. A near time-optimal feedback-form guidance law to determine the direction of the acceleration for guiding the IIP is developed using the de-rivative expressions. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance law, in comparison with the results of open-loop trajectory optimization, was demonstrated through IIP pointing case studies."
aerospace,An iALM-ICA-based Anti-Jamming DS-CDMA Receiver for LMS Systems,"We consider a land mobile satellite communication system using spread spectrum techniques where the uplink is exposed to MT jamming attacks, and the downlink is corrupted by multi-path fading channels. We proposes an anti-jamming receiver, which exploits inherent low-dimensionality of the received signal model, by formulating a robust principal component analysis (Robust PCA)-based recovery problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed receiver outperforms the conventional receiver for a reasonable rank of the jamming signal."
aerospace,Silicate dust in the environment of RS Ophiuchi following the 2006   eruption,"We present further Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, obtained over the period 208-430 days after the 2006 eruption. The later Spitzer IRS data show that the line emission and free-free continuum emission reported earlier is declining, revealing incontrovertible evidence for the presence of silicate emission features at 9.7 and 18microns. We conclude that the silicate dust survives the hard radiation impulse and shock blast wave from the eruption. The existence of the extant dust may have significant implications for understanding the propagation of shocks through the red giant wind and likely wind geometry."
aerospace,Dynamic behavior analysis for a six axis industrial machining robot,"The six axis robots are widely used in automotive industry for their good repeatability (as defined in the ISO92983) (painting, welding, mastic deposition, handling etc.). In the aerospace industry, robot starts to be used for complex applications such as drilling, riveting, fiber placement, NDT, etc. Given the positioning performance of serial robots, precision applications require usually external measurement device with complexes calibration procedure in order to reach the precision needed. New applications in the machining field of composite material (aerospace, naval, or wind turbine for example) intend to use off line programming of serial robot without the use of calibration or external measurement device. For those applications, the position, orientation and path trajectory precision of the tool center point of the robot are needed to generate the machining operation. This article presents the different conditions that currently limit the development of robots in robotic machining applications. We analyze the dynamical behavior of a robot KUKA KR240-2 (located at the University of Bordeaux 1) equipped with a HSM Spindle (42000 rpm, 18kW). This analysis is done in three stages. The first step is determining the self-excited frequencies of the robot structure for three different configurations of work. The second phase aims to analyze the dynamical vibration of the structure as the spindle is activated without cutting. The third stage consists of vibration analysis during a milling operation."
aerospace,"Detection of an H-alpha Emission Line on a Quasar, RX J1759.4+6638, at   z=4.3 with AKARI","We report the detection of an H-alpha emission line in the low resolution spectrum of a quasar, RX J1759.4+6638, at a redshift of 4.3 with the InfraRed Camera (IRC) onboard the AKARI. This is the first spectroscopic detection of an H-alpha emission line in a quasar beyond z=4. The overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of RX J1759.4+6638 in the near- and mid-infrared wavelengths agrees with a median SED of the nearby quasars and the flux ratio of F(Ly-alpha)/F(H-alpha) is consistent with those of previous reports for lower-redshift quasars."
aerospace,A particle filter approach to approximate posterior Cramr-Rao lower   bound,"The posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) derived in Tichavsk\'y et al., 1998, provides a bound on the mean square error (MSE) obtained with any non-linear state filter. Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex, multi-dimensional expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy analytical solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical or simulation based approaches require a priori access to the true states, which may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully designed experiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when the states are hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filters (PF) is proposed. The approach uses SMC methods to estimate the hidden states using a sequence of the available sensor measurements. The developed method is general and can be used to approximate the PCRLB in non-linear systems with non-Gaussian state and sensor noise. The efficacy of the developed method is illustrated on two simulation examples, including a practical problem of ballistic target tracking at re-entry phase."
aerospace,On geodesic deviation in Schwarzschild spacetime,"For metrology, geodesy and gravimetry in space, satellite based instruments and measurement techniques are used and the orbits of the satellites as well as possible deviations between nearby ones are of central interest. The measurement of this deviation itself gives insight into the underlying structure of the spacetime geometry, which is curved and therefore described by the theory of general relativity (GR). In the context of GR, the deviation of nearby geodesics can be described by the Jacobi equation that is a result of linearizing the geodesic equation around a known reference geodesic with respect to the deviation vector and the relative velocity. We review the derivation of this Jacobi equation and restrict ourselves to the simple case of the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution and circular reference geodesics to find solutions by projecting the Jacobi equation on a parallel propagated tetrad as done by Fuchs. Using his results, we construct solutions of the Jacobi equation for different physical initial scenarios inspired by satellite gravimetry missions and give a set of parameter together with their precise impact on satellite orbit deviation. We further consider the Newtonian analog and construct the full solution, that exhibits a similar structure, within this theory."
aerospace,Foundations of Intelligent Additive Manufacturing,"During the last decade, additive manufacturing has become increasingly popular for rapid prototyping, but has remained relatively marginal beyond the scope of prototyping when it comes to applications with tight tolerance specifications, such as in aerospace. Despite a strong desire to supplant many aerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely remained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical components. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive processing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous challenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships through precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback control. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic layers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material specifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control system, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently evolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic specifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly coupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required parameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can be modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications. Therefore, the representation of what is printed changes during the printing process to compensate for eventual imprecision or drift arising during the manufacturing process."
aerospace,Upgrading from Gaussian Processes to Student's-T Processes,"Gaussian process priors are commonly used in aerospace design for performing Bayesian optimization. Nonetheless, Gaussian processes suffer two significant drawbacks: outliers are a priori assumed unlikely, and the posterior variance conditioned on observed data depends only on the locations of those data, not the associated sample values. Student's-T processes are a generalization of Gaussian processes, founded on the Student's-T distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution. Student's-T processes maintain the primary advantages of Gaussian processes (kernel function, analytic update rule) with additional benefits beyond Gaussian processes. The Student's-T distribution has higher Kurtosis than a Gaussian distribution and so outliers are much more likely, and the posterior variance increases or decreases depending on the variance of observed data sample values. Here, we describe Student's-T processes, and discuss their advantages in the context of aerospace optimization. We show how to construct a Student's-T process using a kernel function and how to update the process given new samples. We provide a clear derivation of optimization-relevant quantities such as expected improvement, and contrast with the related computations for Gaussian processes. Finally, we compare the performance of Student's-T processes against Gaussian process on canonical test problems in Bayesian optimization, and apply the Student's-T process to the optimization of an aerostructural design problem."
aerospace,Observability of Strapdown INS Alignment: A Global Perspective,"Alignment of the strapdown inertial navigation system (INS) has strong nonlinearity, even worse when maneuvers, e.g., tumbling techniques, are employed to improve the alignment. There is no general rule to attack the observability of a nonlinear system, so most previous works addressed the observability of the corresponding linearized system by implicitly assuming that the original nonlinear system and the linearized one have identical observability characteristics. Strapdown INS alignment is a nonlinear system that has its own characteristics. Using the inherent properties of strapdown INS, e.g., the attitude evolution on the SO(3) manifold, we start from the basic definition and develop a global and constructive approach to investigate the observability of strapdown INS static and tumbling alignment, highlighting the effects of the attitude maneuver on observability. We prove that strapdown INS alignment, considering the unknown constant sensor biases, will be completely observable if the strapdown INS is rotated successively about two different axes and will be nearly observable for finite known unobservable states (no more than two) if it is rotated about a single axis. Observability from a global perspective provides us with insights into and a clearer picture of the problem, shedding light on previous theoretical results on strapdown INS alignment that were not comprehensive or consistent.. The reporting of inconsistencies calls for a review of all linearization-based observability studies in the vast literature. Extensive simulations with constructed ideal observers and an extended Kalman filter are carried out, and the numerical results accord with the analysis. The conclusions can also assist in designing the optimal tumbling strategy and the appropriate state observer in practice to maximize the alignment performance."
aerospace,AKARI observations of circumstellar dust in the globular clusters NGC104   and NGC362,"We report preliminary results of AKARI observations of two globular clusters, NGC104 and NGC362. Imaging data covering areas of about 10x10 arcmin^2 centered on the two clusters have been obtained with InfraRed Camera (IRC) at 2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0, 15.0, 18.0 and 24.0 mu. We used F11/F2 and F24/F7 flux ratios as diagnostics of circumstellar dust emission. Dust emissions are mainly detected from variable stars obviously on the asymptotic giant branch, but some variable stars that reside below the tip of the first-ascending giant branch also show dust emissions. We found eight red sources with F24/F7 ratio greater than unity in NGC362. Six out of the eight have no 2MASS counterparts. However, we found no such source in NGC104."
aerospace,A Stochastic Global Identification Framework for Aerospace Vehicles   Operating Under Varying Flight States,"In this work, a novel data-based stochastic global identification framework is introduced for air vehicles operating under varying flight states and uncertainty. In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a model that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible flight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework is based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics and aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state characterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack, forming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class of Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit analytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and, hence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype bio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind tunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor networks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing capabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the identification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model parameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector defined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to successfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the admissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared to standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification framework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of fly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities."
aerospace,SOFIA Astronomy and Technology in the 21st Century,"SOFIA, the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy mounted on-board a Boeing 747SP will open a new era in MIR/FIR astronomy. Starting in 2002, SOFIA will offer German and American astronomers a unique platform, providing regular access to the entire MIR and FIR wavelength range between 5 micron and 300 micron part of which is otherwise inaccessible from the ground. SOFIAs 2.7m mirror and optimized telescope system combines the highest available spatial resolution with excellent sensitivity. SOFIA will operate in both celestial hemispheres for the next two decades. In this paper we present an overview of the SOFIA project and the science that this observatory will be able to address."
aerospace,LISA A low Resolution MIR /FIR Imaging Spectrograph for SOFIA,"LISA is a proposed low resolution (R~15-30) imaging spectrometer for SOFIA, the American-German Stratospheric Observatory for Far Infrared Astronomy. Covering the wavelength range from 40micron to 220micron with three channels, LISA provides diffraction limited spectroscopy for each pixel within a rectangular field of view (FOV). The FOV sizes for the channels are 18x11 arcsec for 40 to 70micron, 32x19arcsec for 70-120 micron, and 22x22arcsec for 120-220micron, each channel upgradable to about twice the linear size. LISA will be able to address a variety of astrophysical topic, in particular on faint targets. Spatially resolved temperature distribution of dust emission will be studied in the environments of young and evolved stars, star forming regions, as well as in nuclear regions of nearby galaxies. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of distant galaxies will be determined in search for cold gas components. LISA's spectral resolution will be high enough to search for broad spectral features (e.g. PAHs, ices). The optical design, the mechanical layout, the estimated sensitivity, and the scientific potential of such an instrument is briefly discussed."
aerospace,Silicate Emission in the TW Hydrae Association,"The TW Hydrae Association is the nearest young stellar association. Among its members are HD 98800, HR 4796A, and TW Hydrae itself, the nearest known classical T Tauri star. We have observed these three stars spectroscopically between 3 and 13 microns. In TW Hya the spectrum shows a silicate emission feature that is similar to many other young stars with protostellar disks. The 11.2 micron feature indicative of significant amounts of crystalline olivine is not as strong as in some young stars and solar system comets. In HR 4796A, the thermal emission in the silicate feature is very weak, suggesting little in the way of (small silicate) grains near the star. The silicate band of HD 98800 (observed by us but also reported by Sylvester and Skinner (1996)) is intermediate in strength between TW Hya and HR 4796."
aerospace,Modelling Charge Coupled Device Readout: Simulation Overview and Early   Results,"The Calibration enhancement effort for the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aims to improve data calibration via the application of physical modelling techniques.   We describe here a model of the Charge Transfer process during read-out of modern Charge Coupled Devices, and its application to data from STIS. The model draws upon previous investigations of this process and, in particular, the trapping and emission model developed by Robert Philbrick of Ball Aerospace.   Early comparison to calibration data is encouraging. Essentially, a physical description of the STIS CCD combined with the physics of known defects in the silicon lattice expected to arise in a hostile radiation environment, is enough to yield results which approximately match real data. Uncertainties remain, however, in the details of the model and the physical description of STIS."
aerospace,The Fizeau Interferometer Testbed,"The Fizeau Interferometer Testbed (FIT) is a collaborative effort between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Naval Research Laboratory, Sigma Space Corporation, and the University of Maryland. The testbed will be used to explore the principles of and the requirements for the full, as well as the pathfinder, Stellar Imager mission concept. It has a long term goal of demonstrating closed-loop control of a sparse array of numerous articulated mirrors to keep optical beams in phase and optimize interferometric synthesis imaging. In this paper we present the optical and data acquisition system design of the testbed, and discuss the wavefront sensing and control algorithms to be used. Currently we have completed the initial design and hardware procurement for the FIT. The assembly and testing of the Testbed will be underway at Goddard's Instrument Development Lab in the coming months."
aerospace,Cryogenic Capacitive Transimpedance Amplifier for Astronomical Infrared   Detectors,"We have developed a new capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) that can be operated at 2 K, and have good performance as readout circuits of astronomical far-infrared array detectors. The circuit design of the present CTIA consists of silicon p-MOSFETs and other passive elements. The process is a standard Bi-CMOS process with 0.5$mu$m design rule. The open-loop gain of the CTIA is more than 300, resulting in good integration performance. The output voltage swing of the CTIA was 270 mV. The power consumption for each CTIA is less than 10$mu$W. The noise at the output showed a$1/rm f$noise spectrum of 4$mu$V/$surdhbox Hz$at 1 Hz. The performance of this CTIA nearly fulfills the requirements for the far-infrared array detectors onboard ASTRO-F, Japanese infrared astronomical satellite to be launched in 2005."
aerospace,Rest-Frame MIR Detection of an Extremely Luminous Lyman Break Galaxy   with the Spitzer IRS,"We present the first rest-frame ~4 micron detection of a Lyman break galaxy. The data were obtained using the 16 micron imaging capability of the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. The target object, J134026.44+634433.2, is an extremely luminous Lyman break galaxy at z=2.79 first identified in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra (Bentz, Osmer, & Weinberg 2004). The source is strongly detected with a flux of 0.94 +/- 0.02 mJy. Combining Spitzer and SDSS photometry with supporting ground-based J- and K-band data, we show that the spectral energy distribution is consistent with an actively star-forming galaxy. We also detect other objects in the Spitzer field of view, including a very red MIR source. We find no evidence of a strong lens amongst the MIR sources."
aerospace,Spacecraft Design of VSOP-2,"As presented by Hirabayashi et al. (2004) these proceedings, the VSOP-2 mission is currently being planned. Various kinds of developments are being made for the misson, and here we introduce the large antenna, fast switching scheme using CMG, low noise receivers, gigabit data transmission, and high data rate sampling on-board. We are also studying the system configuration of the VSOP-2 satellite and the orbit appropriate for the expected launch vehicle, the M-V rocket. VSOP-2 science goals include imaging the accretion disks around the massive blackholes in the nuclei of the active galaxies, studies of magnetic field orientation and evolution in jets, and the highest resolution studies of spectral line masers and mega-masers. Here we describe the design and the development of the space antenna, high speed sampler, and the satellite system."
aerospace,Radio Photosphere and Mass-Loss Envelope of VY CMa,We have used the VLA to detect emission from the supergiant VY CMa at radio wavelengths and have constructed 3000-4500 K isothermal outer atmospheres constrained by the data. These models produce a radio photosphere at 1.5-2 R_ast. An extrapolation of the model can account for the observed total mass-loss rate of the star. We also present mid-infrared imaging of the supergiant that suggests warm dust is extended in the same direction as the near-infrared reflection nebula around VY CMa. The origin of the asymmetries in the outflow remains an unsolved problem.
aerospace,A Spitzer Spectrum of the Exoplanet HD 189733b,"We report on the measurement of the 7.5-14.7 micron spectrum for the transiting extrasolar giant planet HD 189733b using the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Though the observations comprise only 12 hours of telescope time, the continuum is well measured and has a flux ranging from 0.6 mJy to 1.8 mJy over the wavelength range, or 0.49 +/- 0.02% of the flux of the parent star. The variation in the measured fractional flux is very nearly flat over the entire wavelength range and shows no indication of significant absorption by water or methane, in contrast with the predictions of most atmospheric models. Models with strong day/night differences appear to be disfavored by the data, suggesting that heat redistribution to the night side of the planet is highly efficient."
aerospace,Two-phase densification of cohesive granular aggregates,"When poured into a container, cohesive granular materials form low-density, open granular aggregates. If pressed upon with a ram, these aggregates densify by particle rearrangement. Here we introduce experimental evidence to the effect that particle rearrangement is a spatially heterogeneous phenomenon, which occurs in the form of a phase transformation between two configurational phases of the granular aggregate. We then show that the energy landscape associated with particle rearrangement is consistent with our interpretation of the experimental results. Besides affording insight into the physics of the granular state, our conclusions are relevant to many engineering processes and natural phenomena."
aerospace,Reconstruction of Residual Stress in a Welded Plate Using the   Variational Eigenstrain Approach,"We present the formulation for finding the distribution of eigenstrains, i.e. the sources of residual stress, from a set of measurements of residual elastic strain (e.g. by diffraction), or residual stress, or stress redistribution, or distortion. The variational formulation employed seeks to achieve the best agreement between the model prediction and some measured parameters in the sense of a minimum of a functional given by a sum over the entire set of measurements. The advantage of this approach lies in its flexibility: different sets of measurements and information about different components of the stress-strain state can be incorporated. We demonstrate the power of the technique by analysing experimental data for welds in thin sheet of a nickel superalloy aerospace material. Very good agreement can be achieved between the prediction and the measurement results without the necessity of using iterative solution. In practice complete characterisation of residual stress states is often very difficult, due to limitations of facility access, measurement time or specimen dimensions. Implications of the new technique for experimental analysis are all the more significant, since it allows the reconstruction of the entire stress state from incomplete sets of data."
aerospace,Model-Based Software Engineering and Ada: Synergy for the Development of   Safety-Critical Systems,"In this paper we outline a software development process for safety-critical systems that aims at combining some of the specific strengths of model-based development with those of programming language based development using safety-critical subsets of Ada. Model-based software development and model-based test case generation techniques are combined with code generation techniques and tools providing a transition from model to code both for a system itself and for its test cases. This allows developers to combine domain-oriented, model-based techniques with source code based validation techniques, as required for conformity with standards for the development of safety-critical software, such as the avionics standard RTCA/DO-178B. We introduce the AutoFocus and Validator modeling and validation toolset and sketch its usage for modeling, test case generation, and code generation in a combined approach, which is further illustrated by a simplified leading edge aerospace model with built-in fault tolerance."
aerospace,Virtual Environments for multiphysics code validation on Computing Grids,"We advocate in this paper the use of grid-based infrastructures that are designed for seamless approaches to the numerical expert users, i.e., the multiphysics applications designers. It relies on sophisticated computing environments based on computing grids, connecting heterogeneous computing resources: mainframes, PC-clusters and workstations running multiphysics codes and utility software, e.g., visualization tools. The approach is based on concepts defined by the HEAVEN* consortium. HEAVEN is a European scientific consortium including industrial partners from the aerospace, telecommunication and software industries, as well as academic research institutes. Currently, the HEAVEN consortium works on a project that aims to create advanced services platforms. It is intended to enable ""virtual private grids"" supporting various environments for users manipulating a suitable high-level interface. This will become the basis for future generalized services allowing the integration of various services without the need to deploy specific grid infrastructures."
